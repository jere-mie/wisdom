    <h2>"Big City Blues"</h2>
  </a>
  <p>
    <i>By Chris Kale</i></p>
  <p>

    A big "Hogtown" hello to everyone back in CS at the University of Windsor. I can't believe
    that it has been seven months since I gave up the C.S.S. Presidency. And what have I been
    doing in those seven months, and why should you care? I'm working at the IBM Software
    Development Lab in Toronto.

  </p>
  <p>The IBM Industry Internship Program (IIP) gives Computer Science students a chance to get
    experience in "The Real World" (I hate that expression) in their chosen career field for a
    leader in the industry (no, I haven't been totally brainwashed). I know that IBM has
    already made a presentation on the IIP to students at Windsor. For those of you that
    missed it, I'm sure the C.S.S. exec, or the Computer Science secretaries would be able to
    give you more specific information, but this is what it boils down to. You take one
    complete year off school, and work sixteen consecutive months. You meet a lot of people.
    Everyone assumes you're a student from the University of Waterloo. And you spend more
    money than you ever thought you would.

  </p>
  <p>IBM targets schools that do not have Co-op programs, like Windsor, for its IIP students.
    I believe that there are other companies with similar programs, and the School of Computer
    Science is trying to entice them to come to Windsor. The biggest benefit of the program is
    that IBM knows that they have you for sixteen months, so they can put you on projects that
    are more involved. You can spend two months training, and learning everything you can about
    your project, and then be productive for the remaining fourteen. Whereas a Co-op student,
    who is only working for four months at a time, may get stuck with a cheesy-do-little job.
    That is not always the case, but I met a guy from Waterloo in May who spent four months at
    IBM pushing VCRs around the building and setting them up for presentations. Not really
    career advancement for a CS major.I think the biggest concern that I had about the program
    was being able to fit in. I mean, I had a little computer work experience, but nothing
    that would compare to people working at IBM. I also thought it might be a sea of blue suits
    , red ties, and short hair. My manager met me on my first day and almost fit that
    description - his suit wasn't blue. As we wandered around on the whirlwind tour, I saw that
    not everyone was dressed formally. I finally met my supervisor. He was wearing a Labatt's
    t-shirt, blue jeans, and running shoes. He asked me, "Why are you wearing that tie?" I
    instantly felt at ease.

  </p>
  <p>The other thing that I had going for me was that everyone saw me as a student. They
    didn't expect me to know everything right away. Oh sure, they wanted me to turn my PS/2
    on immediately, but that's what 60-104 is for isn't it? The people here were, and are very
    supportive of everyone, full timers, and students. Everyone is assigned a mentor. Your
    mentor is a full time employee working on your team, and is responsible for assigning you
    work. But they're also your first point of contact. If you have a question, just ask your
    mentor. ANYTHING! IBM does not want you to sit around and wait for someone to ask if
    everything is ok. This is not a restaurant. My mentor graduated from the University of
    Toronto in 1989, and he was also an IIP student, so he could identify with my concerns,
    and problems. That helped me a lot.

  </p>
  <p>The major thing that you'll notice if you work for IBM, is that everything is reduced to
    an acronym. Not a big surprise if you think about who you're working for. I'm currently in
    D.S. - Distributed Systems. It's kind of like networking, and distributed processing.
    Allowing a number of computers to work together to solve a problem, and communicate with
    each other. The other three students from Windsor that were accepted this year are Shawn
    Laliberte, Lisa Fisher, and Gerry Greenwood. Shawn is in AS/400 - IBM's product to compete
    against UNIX. Lisa is in C370 - Mainframe C Language, and Gerry is in Workstation Database.
    We all enjoy what we're doing, and in talking to everyone, IBM seems pleased with what we
    are doing too. We're doing our best to try and make CS students from Windsor look good.

  </p>
  <p>Living in Toronto is not as bad as some people make it out to be. Yes, everything is
    expensive. Yes, the city is really, really crowded. Yes, the air is polluted. But there
    is a lot to do here. Being a life-long Maple Leafs fan, ok - I'll admit it - go ahead
    laugh, and boo me if you want, I can now watch them LIVE, and maybe win once in a while.
    Actually, one of the Vice Presidents of IBM Canada GAVE me two free Leaf Tickets because
    I have my pennant sticking up on my office wall. If you don't mind the BIG CITY, then
    living here is no huge deal. And if anyone is planning on moving up in September 1993, I
    know where there's a nice 3 bedroom townhouse available....

  </p>
  <p>I think that's about all for now. If you have any specific questions on the IIP, or IBM
    you can give them to Al Siodlowski (Your beloved Wisdom Editor) and he'll forward them to
    me. Hopefully if all goes well, the questions and answers will be printed in the next
    issue of Wisdom.

  </p>
  <p>Good luck to everyone on their finals - that's one thing I definitely do not miss! Have
    fun! And, yep it that time of year already, Happy Holidays!

    <h2>"Toasters"</h2>
  </a>
  <p>

    <i>From: Cori Lewin (Comedy from the Internet)</i>

  </p>
  <p>Once upon a time, in a kingdom not far from here, a king summoned two of his advisors
    for a test. He showed them both a shiny metal box with two slots in the top, a control
    knob, and a lever. "What do you think this is?" One advisor, an engineer, answered first.
    "It is a toaster," he said.

  </p>
  <p>The king asked, "How would you design an embedded computer for it?" The engineer
    replied, "Using a four-bit microcontroller, I would write a simple program that reads the
    darkness knob and quantizes its position to one of 16 shades of darkness, from snow white
    to coal black. The program would use that darkness level as the index to a 16-element table
    of initial timer values. Then it would turn on the heating elements and start the timer
    with the initial value selected from the table. At the end of the time delay, it would turn
    off the heat and pop up the toast. Come back next week, and I'll show you a working
    prototype."

  </p>
  <p>The second advisor, a computer scientist, immediately recognized the danger of such
    short-sighted thinking. He said, "Toasters don't just turn bread into toast, they are also
    used to warm frozen waffles. What you see before you is really a breakfast food cooker. As
    the subjects of your kingdom become more sophisticated, they will demand more capabilities.
    They will need a breakfast food cooker that can also cook sausage, fry bacon, and make
    scrambled eggs. A toaster that only makes toast will soon be obsolete. If we don't look to
    the future, we will have to completely redesign the toaster in just a few years.

  </p>
  <p>"With this in mind, we can formulate a more intelligent solution to the problem. First,
    create a class of breakfast foods. Specialize this class into subclasses: grains, pork,
    and poultry. The specialization process should be repeated with grains divided into toast,
    muffins, pancakes, and waffles; pork divided into sausage, links, and bacon; and poultry
    divided into scrambled eggs, hard-boiled eggs, poached eggs, fried eggs, and various
    omelet classes. "The ham and cheese omelet class is worth special attention because it
    must inherit characteristics from the pork, dairy, and poultry classes. Thus, we see that
    the problem cannot be properly solved without multiple inheritance. At run time, the
    program must create the proper object and send a message to the object that says, `Cook
    yourself.' The semantics of this message depend, of course, on the kind of object, so they
    have a different meaning to a piece of toast than to scrambled eggs.

  </p>
  <p>"Reviewing the process so far, we see that the analysis phase has revealed that the
    primary requirement is to cook any kind of breakfast food. In the design phase, we have
    discovered some derived requirements. Specifically, we need an object-oriented language
    with multiple inheritance. Of course, users don't want the eggs to get cold while the
    bacon is frying, so concurrent processing is required, too.

  </p>
  <p>"We must not forget the user interface. The lever that lowers the food lacks
    versatility, and the darkness knob is confusing. Users won't buy the product unless it has
    a user-friendly, graphical interface. When the breakfast cooker is plugged in, users should see a
    cowboy boot on the screen. Users click on it, and the message `Booting UNIX v. 8.3' appears on the
    screen. (UNIX 8.3 should be out by the time the product gets to the market.) Users can pull down a
    menu and click on the foods they want to cook.

  </p>
  <p>"Having made the wise decision of specifying the software first in the design phase,
    all that remains is to pick an adequate hardware platform for the implementation phase. An
    Intel 80386 with 8MB of memory, a 30MB hard disk, and a VGA monitor should be sufficient.
    If you select a multitasking, object oriented language that supports multiple inheritance
    and has a built-in GUI, writing the program will be a snap. (Imagine the difficulty we
    would have had if we had foolishly allowed a hardware-first design strategy to lock us
    into a four-bit microcontroller!)."

  </p>
  <p>The king had the computer scientist's head chopped off, and they all lived happily ever
    after.

    <i>by the 2nd Yr. Rep. - C. Cabreros</i>

  </p>
  <p>How was everybody's holidays? Great? Wonderful? Too Short?? Mine was very relaxing. Welcome
    back to another semester here at the U.

  </p>
  <p>This month the Computer Science Society ( C.S.S. ) has many things planned. Starting this
    week Jan. 18 - Jan. 22 we will be holding a pool tournament,
    <a href="#dates">
      more details will be found elsewhere
      in this newsletter.</a>


  </p>
  <p>For all those people interested in playing volleyball we will be trying to get the courts
    booked on Fridays, and maybe the odd Saturday or Sunday. If there's enough interest for
    basketball, we could try and book those courts also.

  </p>
  <p>The CSS executive is here for you. If you have any questions, concerns but most of all
    ideas for events that you would attend. Please don't hesitate to come up and talk to any of us.

  </p>
  <p>Back to January. The week of 25th- 29th (last week of January) the C.S.S. will be having on
    the Wednesday (27th) a Tolkein Looney Movie Night to "RING IN THE NEW YEAR!!! ".

  </p>
  <p>Also the idea of a ski trip is being tossed around, if you are interested please leave your
    name in the CSS office (5108 Lambton Tower). We'd like to make sure there's enough people
    interested before we make final preparations. Please let us know because we need a minimum
    number of people to go.

  </p>
  <p>And for you creative Computer Science Majors, we are having a contest for a slogan and
    picture for the backs of the CSS sweatshirts. The one that gets chosen will get a sweatshirt
    at no cost. So get those ideas in to the exec by JANUARY 29th, 1993. Enclosed there will be
    an order form for sweatshirts. Deadlines and other vital stuff are here in this edition of
    the Wisdom, so continue reading there's more interesting stuff.

    <h2>AutoFact `92</h2>
  </a>
  <p>
    <i>by Amie Flexner</i>

  </p>
  <p>On 11 Nov. I attended Autofact, an international expo for today's automated and
    integrated factory. This show had a lot of exhibitors displaying hardware, and various
    types of software, mostly CAD/CAM/CAE, or some other similar systems. The Expo took place
    at Cobo Center in Detroit for three days. Among the represented companies were SGI, SUN,
    Hewlett Packard, Autodesk (which puts out AutoCad), Apple Computers, Cray, AT&amp;T;, Digital
    Equipment, along with many others.

  </p>
  <p>I picked up a lot of materials from various companies as I walked around the expo,
    these are available for people to peruse, and/or borrow in the CSS office for the duration.

  </p>
  <p>The 300 companies displaying their wares were spread out enough that there was no way
    for me attend all their booths in the limited time I was there, but I did do my best. I
    watched some demos on some fabulous programs, and saw some things about some really neat
    relatively new companies and the things they are putting out. One of these was called
    Wisdom Technologies and is doing a number of things that sounded fascinating as I listened
    to their sales pitch.

  </p>
  <p>Feel free to come up to the CSS office to learn more, either by talking to me, or by
    looking through the available materials.

    <h2>Ski Trip</h2>
  </a>

  <p>This year the C.S.S. is looking into a ski trip. The trip would involve leaving here on
    a Friday night by bus and staying at a hotel for the night. The next day would be skiing,
    skiing and more skiing then at night back on the bus for Windsor. The locations being
    looked into are northern Michigan and Ontario.

  </p>
  <p>The price and location will be determined if enough people want to go. If we get 25 or
    more people signed up, then we would have enough to fill a bus and to get group rates on
    the lift and hotel rates.

  </p>
  <p>We will have a sheet in the office (LT 5108) for people to sign up. Signing up doesn't
    mean a commitment but rather signals that you are very interested in going and also so that
    we know if there are enough people to go through with this.

    <h2>The Movie Marathon: What A Success!</h2>
  </a>
  <p>
    <i>by Christine Cabreros</i>

  </p>
  <p>It started ar 11:45 am and ended at 7:15 pm. The movie that began the night was Monty
    Python: <b>In Search Of THe Holy Grail</b>. This movie had the greatest crowd of all the
    movies. It was humorous in the Monty Python way. So all those Monty fans that missed out on
    all the fun, may be next year. During the short intermission some of the fans left to class
    and elsewhere but we moved on. We served subs from `The Subway' for $1 and pop for $0.50.

  </p>
  <p>Next up on the agenda was <b>Predator II</b>. A good violent film to get the blood moving
    since the temperature of the room seemed to be getting dropping. As most remember the film
    was about aliens or in this case predators from another planet in search of the greatest
    warrior to be found in New York City.

  </p>
  <p>Following this film was, (suspense here), you got it, <b>Star Trek VI</b>, which was
    another popular gathering of people. People waiting to watch this movie came in during the
    intermission just to find a seat. (Sorry, no popcorn!) The subs were disappearing and
    there seemed to small mutterings of wanting some warm food such as pizza. This muttering
    was hushed as Captain Kirk was volunteered to escort the Klingon Ambassador to a peace
    talk. By the end of the movie everybody was engrossed when the plot to foil the peace was
    thwarted. People enjoyed themselves to the max. Pizza came and there was a sudden rush for
    the warm food. Things were going marvelously.

  </p>
  <p>The last movie was <b>Sister Act</b> starring Whoopie Goldberg. This must have been the
    funniest movie of the day, the whole room was filled with munching and laughing people. At
    the end we knew it had been a success. Everyone left with smiles and mutterings of `when's
    the next movie night?' and what does that tell you???

  </p>
  <p>The Computer Science Society Executive thanks everyone who attended and we hope to see
    more of you out to the society's events.
