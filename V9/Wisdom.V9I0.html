  <h2> From the president's terminal</h2>
  <p>

    Hiya! Me, I'm the CSS President. CSS -- Computer Science Society, an
    organization run by the CS students FOR the CS students. This is important to
    know, because well, we need representation from you, the First Year students
    as well. So be ready to run for elected office when you get here in September!
    WE need YOU, and YOU need to be with US.</p>
  <p>

    Now, what IS it that we do that WE need YOU for? Lotsa things. We organize
    social events (well, as much as CS students can
    BE social) for CS students...not usually RESTRICTED to them, but always with
    preferential treatment to them. We sell
    hotdogs for charity, go on Pub Crawls and sporting events, hold General
    Meetings so that you can talk to your Executive,
    usually over free `beverages' and food. We organize academic events as well,
    seminars from Career Planning and Placement, guest speakers. </p>
  <p>

    Basically, we have fun, and try to have more fun. Then, when we get tired, it's
    5 AM, and we go to sleep for 6 hours
    before classes begin...unless you have some weird options that make you get up
    at Euwwww 10 AM! Come by and see what we
    do...Lambton Tower, room 5108..same floor as all the profs, but don't hold that
    against us!,</p>
