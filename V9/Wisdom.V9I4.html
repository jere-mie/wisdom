    <h2>35 Fun Things To Do For a Final Exam</h2>
  </a>
  <p>
    <i>sent to us by our Toronto Wisdom corespondent, Chris Kale</i></p>
  <p>

    This just in time before we all start our gruelling week of exams:

  </p>
  <p> 35 Fun things to do in a final that does not matter (i.e. you are going to fail
    the class completely no matter what you get on the final exam or you are will pass
    the class even if you fail the final).

  </p>
  <ol>
    <li> Bring a pillow. Fall asleep (or pretend to) until the last 15 minutes. Wake up,
      say "oh geez, better get cracking" and do some gibberish work. Turn it in a few
      minutes early.
    </li>
    <li> Get a copy of the exam, run out screaming "Andre, Andre, I've got the secret
      documents!!!"
    </li>
    <li> If it is a math/science exam, answer in essay form. If it is long answer/essay
      form, answer with numbers and symbols. Be creative. Use the integral symbol.
    </li>
    <li> Make paper airplanes out of the exam. Aim them at the instructor's left nostril.
    </li>
    <li> Talk the entire way through the exam. Read questions aloud, debate your answers
      with yourself out loud. If asked to stop, yell out, "I'm SOOO sure you can hear me
      thinking." Then start talking about what a jerk the instructor is.
      <p>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li> One word: Wrestlemania.
    </li>
    <li> Bring a musical instrument with you, play various tunes. If you are asked to
      stop, say "it helps me think." Bring a copy of the Student Handbook with you,
      challenging the instructor to find the section on musical instruments during finals.
      Don't forget to use the phrase "Told you so".
    </li>
    <li> Bring a Game Boy (or Game Gear, etc...). Play with the volume at max level.
    </li>
    <li> On the answer sheet (book, whatever) find a new, interesting way to refuse to
      answer every question. For example: I refuse to answer this question on the grounds
      that it conflicts with my religious beliefs. Be creative.
    </li>
    <li> Bring pets.
      <p>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li> Run into the exam room looking about frantically. Breathe a sigh of relief. Go
      to the instructor, say "They've found me, I have to leave the country" and run off.
    </li>
    <li> Bring some large, cumbersome, ugly idol. Put it right next to you. Pray to it
      often. Consider a small sacrifice.
    </li>
    <li> Do the exam with crayons, paint, or fluorescent markers.
    </li>
    <li> Come into the exam wearing slippers, a bathrobe, a towel on your head, and
      nothing else.
    </li>
    <li> Play frisbee with a friend at the other side of the room.
      <p>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li> Do the entire exam in another language. If you don't know one, make one up! For
      math/science exams, try using Roman numerals.
    </li>
    <li> For a Computer Science exam, use a different computer language (i.e. for 60-110,
      write the final in assembler or Prolog).
    </li>
    <li> Bring cheat sheets FOR ANOTHER CLASS (make sure this is obvious... like history
      notes for a calculus exam... otherwise you're not just failing, you're getting kicked
      out too) and staple them to the exam, with the comment "Please use the attached notes
      for references as you see fit."
    </li>
    <li> As soon as the instructor hands you the exam, eat it.
    </li>
    <li> Every five minutes, stand up, collect all your things, move to another seat,
      continue with the exam.
      <p>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li> Turn in the exam approximately 30 minutes into it. As you walk out, start
      commenting on how easy it was.
    </li>
    <li> Complete the exam with everything you write being backwards at a 90 degree angle.
    </li>
    <li> Bring a black marker. Return the exam with all questions and answers completely
      blacked out.
    </li>
    <li> Try to get people in the room to do the wave.
    </li>
    <li> From the moment the exam begins, hum the theme to Jeopardy. Ignore the
      instructor's requests for you to stop. When they finally get you to leave one way or
      another, begin whistling the theme to the Bridge on the River Kwai.
      <p>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li> After you get the exam, call the instructor over, point to any question, ask for
      the answer. Try to work it out of him/her.
    </li>
    <li> Every now and then, clap twice rapidly. If the instructor asks why, tell him/her
      in a very derogatory tone, "the light bulb that goes on above my head when I get an
      idea is hooked up to a clapper. DUH!"
    </li>
    <li> Get deliveries of candy, flowers, balloons, telegrams, etc... sent to you every
      few minutes throughout the exam.
    </li>
    <li> Come to the exam wearing a black cloak. After about 30 minutes, put on a white
      mask and start yelling "I'm here, the phantom of the opera" until they drag you away.
    </li>
    <li> Go to an exam for a class you have no clue about, where you know the class is
      very small, and the instructor would recognize you if you belonged. Claim that you
      have been to every lecture. Fight for your right to take the exam.
      <p>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li> Come in wearing a full knight's outfit, complete with sword and shield.
    </li>
    <li> Bring a water pistol with you. Nuff said.
    </li>
    <li> Bring balloons, blow them up, start throwing them around like they do before
      concerts start.
    </li>
    <li> If the exam is math/science related, make up the longest proofs you could
      possibly think of. Get pi and imaginary numbers into most equations. If it is a
      written exam, relate everything to your own life story.
    </li>
  </ol>

    <h2>Ski Trip</h2>
  </a>

  <p> Well the ski trip that the C.S.S. organized on Saturday the 8th of February was
    a success! We all had fun and the weather was perfect, cold enough so that the snow
    didn't melt but not too cold as to freeze. We left here at 7:30 am and got back at
    around 8:00 pm.

  </p>
  <p> We all had fun, some fell, some didn't fall at all. Some people were learning
    to ski for the first time while others were tackling the moguls (while learning to
    ski for the first time!).

  </p>
  <p> While the slopes were closed for the change over to the new shift and to groom
    the slopes, we were taking advantage of the `refreshment' facilities at the lodge
    (see pictures). We will organizing next year's trip in Oct. or Nov.
  </p>
  <p>

    A few moments of rest after a gruelling day of skiing at Alpine Valley.

  </p>
  <p>

    More enjoyment at the ski lodge. We did do some skiing, really, we just didn't have
    cameras with us on the slopes, really!

    <h2>Password Humour</h2>
  </a>
  <p>
    <i>sent to us by Chris Kale from our Toronto Wisdom office.</i>

  </p>
  <p> Here is a good (and funny) example of what happens when the security
    procedures are a bit too tight!

  </p>
  <p>CORPORATE DIRECTIVE# 84-570471 April 1, 1984

  </p>
  <p> In order to increase the security of all our computing facilities, and to avoid
    the possibility of unauthorized use of these facilities, new rules are being put
    into effect concerning the selection of passwords. All users of our computing
    facilities are instructed to change their passwords to conform to these rules
    immediately.

  </p>
  <p> RULES FOR THE SELECTION OF PASSWORDS:

  </p>
  <ul>
    <li> A password must be at least six characters long, and must not contain two
      occurrences of a character in a row, or a sequence of two or more characters from
      the alphabet in forward or reverse order. Example: HGQQXP is an invalid password.
      GFEDCB is an invalid password.

    </li>
    <li> A password may not contain two or more letters in the same position as any
      previous password. Example: If a previous password was GKPWTZ, then NRPWHS would be
      invalid because PW occurs in the same position in both passwords.

    </li>
    <li> A password may not contain the name of a month or an abbreviation for a
      month. Example: MARCHBC is an invalid password. VWMARBC is an invalid password.

    </li>
    <li> A password may not contain the numeric representation of a month. Therefore,
      a password containing any number except zero is invalid. Example: WKBH3LG is invalid
      because it contains the numeric representation for the month of March.

    </li>
    <li> A password may not contain any words from any language. Thus, a password may
      not contain the letters A, or I, or sequences such as AT, ME, or TO because these
      are all words.

    </li>
    <li> A password may not contain sequences of two or more characters which are
      adjacent to each other on a keyboard in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal
      direction. Example: QWERTY is an invalid password. GHNLWT is an invalid password
      because G and H are horizontally adjacent to each other. HUKWVM is an invalid
      password because H and U are diagonally adjacent to each other.

    </li>
    <li> A password may not contain the name of a person, place or thing. Example:
      JOHNBOY is an invalid password.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p> Because of the complexity of the password selection rules, there is actually
    only one password which passes all the tests. To make the selection of this
    password simpler for the user, it will be distributed to all managers. All users
    are instructed to obtain this password from his or her manager and begin using it
    immediately.

    <h2>Year End From 2nd Year Rep</h2>
  </a>

  <p> Well, it's definitely that time of year again. Time to write the finals and
    then go to that place called home. No matter where it is, whether it is here in
    Windsor or elsewhere around the world, home is where the family is. And usually
    where the family is there is warmth and love.

  </p>
  <p> Enough of the mush. This year has definitely been a long, tough and interesting
    year. As the `so-called' 2nd year rep. of the Computer Science Society, I will have
    to admit that my duties to you, the students have been neglected especially in
    relaying the times, dates, and the whats that have been going on in the Society.
    But I have been doing things behind the scenes that would make you proud.

  </p>
  <p> I worked on the sweatshirt sales, mugs sales, cider &amp; cookie sales and I wrote
    some articles that you may have even enjoyed. I helped out with movie night and pool
    tournaments. The ski trip was a Blast! There have been many things that have been
    going on.

  </p>
  <p> There's General Meetings and Student / Staff Luncheons, there's Executive
    meetings and lots of fun. But all in all I think that this year has been a success.
    I met lots of first year students and kept in touch with the second year students.

  </p>
  <p> Here's to summer and lots of fun!!! Bye everybody!! And good luck to you next year!

  <p>According to late breaking news: The School of Computer Science is getting new
    X-Terminals. Some will have colour and sound. The University Computer Center is
    upgrading the SGI 4D/340S with the new MIPS 4400 CPU's (no word on how many) but
    it is reported to increase the processing power by 10 to 15 times. Finally the IBM

  <p> Well it's been a good year. I hope your's has been productive. The society has
    had many successful events spanning from pool tournaments to movie nights to our
    fabulous ski trip. The year's not over yet and other events are still in the works.
    More on this later.

  </p>
  <p> Special thanks to the Grad House for their allowance of our `theatre' and
    to `TILT' for their high quality pool equipment. Finally thanks to you the students,
    without you there would is no successful social events. Once again your suggestions
    are welcome.

  <p>
    <i>by Alain Siodlowski</i>

  </p>
  <p> Well once again it's the end of the year (academically speaking) for us. Exams
    will be starting soon, but we still have a few events left! We are also gearing up
    for next semester.

  </p>
  <p> But first, the events. First and foremost is the general meeting this Thursday
    when the new executive will be formally announced. There will be the
    usual `refreshments' and pizza afterwards. All FREE as usual! This is a great
    opportunity to meet new people and to find out more about what the society has
    planned for next year.

  </p>
  <p> There is also the end of semester pizza luncheon. This luncheon that we, along
    with the School of Computer Science, have been holding at the end of every semester
    for the past year or two, is way for the students in CS to meet the profs and other
    students. The pizza and pop is FREE. Look for posters and listen for announcements
    in class for the time and place.

  </p>
  <p> As for the Wisdom, if you would like to write about anything relating to
    computer science then send it to me at <i>wisdom@cs.uwindsor.ca</i> and you will get
    the usual $5.00 per printed article. If you have any suggestions as for topics,
    then talk to me or e-mail me.

  </p>
  <p> Well this is the end of the column, so I'm out of space. Good luck on your exams!
