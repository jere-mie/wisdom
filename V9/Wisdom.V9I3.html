    <h2>Hot Cider</h2>
  </a>
  <p>
    <i>by Christine Cabreros</i>

  </p>
  <p>It was a cold and snowy day when the executive of the Computer Science Society decided to
    have a cider sale with gingerbread cookies on the side.

  </p>
  <p>The day began with a cold gust of snow and a chill in the air that could be felt all the
    way to the bone. The urns that were to heat the cider arrived at approximately 8:30 am. The
    sale was to begin at 10:00am but because of the bitter wind and snow, the cider decided that
    it wanted to take a long time to even warm up.

  </p>
  <p>But even with the slow warming of the cider the overall sale was pretty good and the
    gingerbread cookies were definitely a success. A special thanks goes out to the executive and
    friends who stood out in the cold, watched the students and Proffs go by, and especially to
    those who bought cider and cookies and who acknowledged our presence outside of Lambton Tower.

  </p>
  <p>Thanks for the Support!

    <h2>CD Technology</h2>
  </a>
  <p>
    <i>Article on the Internet</i>

  </p>
  <p>The following is a nice intro to CD technology written by Andy Poggio in 1988.

  </p>
  <p></p>
  <h3>Abstract</h3>

  <p>This summary describes how information is encoded on Compact Disc (CD) beginning with the
    physical pits and going up through higher levels of data encoding to the structured multimedia
    information that is possible with programs like HyperCard. This discussion is much broader
    than any single standards document, e.g. the CD-Audio Red Book, while omitting much of the
    detail needed only by drive manufacturers.

  </p>
  <p></p>
  <h3>Salient Characteristics</h3>

  <dl>
    <dt> 1. High information density.
    </dt>
    <dd> With the density achievable using optical encoding, the CD
      can contain some 540 megabytes of data on a disc less than five inches in diameter.

    </dd>
    <dt> 2. Low unit cost.
    </dt>
    <dd> Because CDs are manufactured by a well-developed process similar to that
      used to stamp out LP records, unit cost in large quantities is less than two dollars.

    </dd>
    <dt> 3. Read only medium.
    </dt>
    <dd> CD-ROM is read only; it cannot be written on or erased. It is an
      electronic publishing, distribution, and access medium; it cannot replace magnetic disks.

    </dd>
    <dt> 4. Modest random access performance.
    </dt>
    <dd> Due to optical read head mass and data encoding
      methods, random access ("seek time") performance of CD is better than floppies but not as
      good as magnetic hard disks.

    </dd>
    <dt> 5. Robust, removable medium.
    </dt>
    <dd> The CD itself is comprised mostly of, and completely coated by,
      durable plastic. This fact and the data encoding method allow the CD to be resistant to
      scratches and other handling damage. Media lifetime is expected to be long, well beyond that
      of magnetic media such as tape. In addition, the optical servo scanning mechanism allows CDs
      to be removed from their drives.

    </dd>
    <dt> 6. Multimedia storage.
    </dt>
    <dd> Because all CD data is stored digitally, it is inherently multimedia
      in that it can store text, images, graphics, sound, and any other information expressed in
      digital form. Its only limit in this area is the rate at which data can be read from the
      disc, currently about 150 KBytes/second. This is sufficient for all but uncompressed, full
      motion color video.
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <p></p>
  <h3>CD Data Hierarchy</h3>

  <p>Storing data on a CD may be thought of as occurring through a data encoding hierarchy with
    each level built upon the previous one. At the lowest level, data is physically stored as
    pits on the disc. It is actually encoded by several low-level mechanisms to provide high
    storage density and reliable data recovery. At the next level, it organized into tracks which
    may be digital audio or CD-ROM. The High Sierra specification then defines a file system
    built on CD-ROM tracks. Finally, applications like HyperCard specify a content format for files.

  </p>
  <p></p>
  <h3>The Physical Medium</h3>

  <p>The Compact Disc itself is a thin plastic disk some 12 cm. in diameter. Information is
    encoded in a plastic-encased spiral track contained on the top of the disk. The spiral track is
    read optically by a non contact head which scans approximately radially as the disk spins just
    above it. The spiral is scanned at a constant linear velocity thus assuring a constant data
    rate. This requires the disc to rotate at a decreasing rate as the spiral is scanned from its
    beginning near the center of the disc to its end near the disc circumference.

  </p>
  <p>The spiral track contains shallow depressions, called pits, in a reflective layer. Binary
    information is encoded by the lengths of these pits and the lengths of the areas between them,
    called land. During reading, a low power laser beam from the optical head is focused on the
    spiral layer and is reflected back into the head. Due to the optical characteristics of the
    plastic disc and the wavelength of light used, the quantity of reflected light varies
    depending on whether the beam is on land or on a pit. The modulated, reflected light is
    converted to a radio frequency, raw data signal by a photodetector in the optical head.

  </p>
  <p></p>
  <h3>Low-level Data Encoding</h3>

  <p>To ensure accurate recovery, the disc data must be encoded to optimize the analog-to-digital
    conversion process that the radio frequency signal must undergo. Goals of the low level data
    encoding include:

  </p>
  <dl>
    <dt> 1. High information density.
    </dt>
    <dd> This requires encoding that makes the best possible use of the
      high, but limited, resolution of the laser beam and read head optics.

    </dd>
    <dt> 2. Minimum inter symbol interference.
    </dt>
    <dd> This requires making the minimum run length, i.e. the
      minimum number of consecutive zero bits or one bits, as large as possible.

    </dd>
    <dt> 3. Self-clocking.
    </dt>
    <dd> To avoid a separate timing track, the data should be encoded so as to allow
      the clock signal to be regenerated from the data signal. This requires limiting the maximum
      run length of the data so that data transitions will regenerate the clock.

    </dd>
    <dt> 4. Low digital sum value (the number of one bits minus the number of zero bits).
    </dt>
    <dd> This minimizes the low frequency and DC content of the data signal which permits optimal
      servo system operation.
    </dd>
  </dl>

  A straightforward encoding would be to simply to encode zero bits as land and one bits as
  pits. However, this does not meet goal (1) as well as the encoding scheme actually used. The
  current CD scheme encodes one bits as transitions from pit to land or land to pit and zero
  bits as constant pit or constant land.
  To meet goals (2) to (4), it is not possible to encode arbitrary binary data. For example, the
  integer 0 expressed as thirty-two bits of zero would have too long a run length to satisfy
  goal (3). To accommodate these goals, each eight-bit byte of actual data is encoded as
  fourteen bits of channel data. There are many more combinations of fourteen bits (16,384)
  than there are of eight bits (256). To encode the eight-bit combinations, 256 combinations of
  fourteen bits are chosen that meet the goals. This encoding is referred to as
  Eight-to-Fourteen Modulation (EFM) coding.

  <p>If fourteen channel bits were concatenated with another set of fourteen channel bits, once
    again the above goals may not be met. To avoid this possibility, three merging bits are
    included between each set of fourteen channel bits. These merging bits carry no information
    but are chosen to limit run length, keep data signal DC content low, etc. Thus, an eight bit
    byte of actual data is encoded into a total of seventeen channel bits: fourteen EFM bits and
    three merging bits.
    To achieve a reliable self-clocking system, periodic synchronization is necessary. Thus, data
    is broken up into individual frames each beginning with a synchronization pattern. Each frame
    also contains twenty-four data bytes, eight error correction bytes, a control and display
    byte (carrying the subcoding channels), and merging bits separating them all. Each frame is
    arranged as follows:

  </p>
  <pre>Sync Pattern :			24 + 3 channel bits
Control and Display byte :	14 + 3
Data bytes :			12 * (14 + 3)
Error Correction bytes :	 4 * (14 + 3)
Data bytes :			12 * (14 + 3)
Error Correction bytes :	 4 * (14 + 3)
TOTAL : 			588 channel bits
Thus, 192 actual data bits (24 bytes) are encoded as 588 channel bits.
</pre>

  <p><b>Editorial:</b> A CD physically has a single spiral track about 3 miles long. CDs spin
    at about 500 RPM when reading near the center down to about 250 RPM when reading near the
    circumference. Disc with a `c' or disk with a `k'? A usage has emerged for these terms: disk
    is used for erasable disks (e.g. magnetic disks) while disc is used for read-only (e.g.
    CD-ROM discs). One would presumably call a frisbee a disc.

  </p>
  <p></p>
  <h3>First Level Error Correction</h3>

  <p>Data errors can arise from production defects in the disk itself, defects arising from
    subsequent damage to the disk, or jarring during reading. A significant characteristic of
    these errors is that they often occur in long bursts. This could be due, for example, to a
    relatively wide mark on the disc that is opaque to the laser beam used to read the disc. A
    system with two logical components called the Cross Interleave Reed-Solomon Coding (CIRC) is
    employed for error correction. The cross interleave component breaks up the long error bursts
    into many short errors; the Reed-Solomon component provides the error correction.

  </p>
  <p>As each frame is read from the disc, it is first decoded from fourteen channel bits (the
    three merging bits are ignored) into eight-bit data bytes. Then, the bytes from each frame
    (twenty-four data bytes and eight error correction bytes) are passed to the first Reed-Solomon
    decoder which uses four of the error correction bytes and is able to correct one byte in error
    out of the 32. If there are no uncorrectable errors, the data is simply passed along. If
    there are errors, the data is marked as being in error at this stage of decoding.

  </p>
  <p>The twenty-four data bytes and four remaining error correction bytes are then passed
    through unequal delays before going through another Reed-Solomon decoder. These unequal
    delays result in an interleaving of the data that spreads long error bursts among many
    different passes through the second decoder. The delays are such that error bursts up to
    450 bytes long can be completely corrected. The second Reed-Solomon decoder uses the last
    four error correction bytes to correct any remaining errors in the twenty-four data bytes.
    At this point, the data goes through a de-interleaving process to restore the correct byte
    order.

  </p>
  <p></p>
  <h3>Subcoding Channels and Blocks</h3>

  <p>The eight-bit control and display byte in each frame carries the subcoding channels. A
    subcoding block consists of 98 subcoding bytes, and thus 98 of the 588-bit frames. A block
    then can contain 2352 bytes of data. Seventy-five blocks are read each second. With this
    information, it is now straightforward to calculate that the CD data rate is in fact correct
    for CD digital audio (CD-DA):

  </p>
  <dl>
    <dt> Required CD digital audio data rate:
    </dt>
    <dd> 44.1 K samples per second * 16 bits per sample * 2 channels = 1,411,200 bits/sec.
      <p>
      </p>
    </dd>
    <dt> CD data rate:
    </dt>
    <dd> 8 bits per byte * 24 bytes per frame * 98 frames per subcoding block * 75
      subcoding blocks per second = 1,411,200 bits/sec.
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>The eight subcoding channels are labeled P through W and are encoded one bit for each
    channel in a control and display byte. Channel P is used as a simple music track separator.
    Channel Q is used for control purposes and encodes information like track number, track type,
    and location (minute, second, and frame number). During the lead-in track of the disc,
    channel Q encodes a table of contents for the disk giving track number and starting location.
    Standards have been proposed that would use the remaining channels for line graphics and
    ASCII character strings, but these are seldom used.

  </p>
  <p></p>
  <h3>Track Types</h3>

  <p>Tracks can have two types as specified in the control bit field of subchannel Q. The first
    type is CD digital audio (CD-DA) tracks. The two-channel audio is sampled at 44.1 Khz with
    sixteen bit linear sampling encoded as twos complement numbers. The sixteen bit samples are
    separated into two eight-bit bytes; the bytes from each channel alternate on the disc.
    Variations for audio tracks include pre-emphasis and four track recording.

  </p>
  <p>The other type of track specified by the subchannel Q control bit field is the data track.
    These must conform to the CD-ROM standard described below. In general, a disc can have a mix
    of CD digital audio tracks and a CD-ROM track, but the CD-ROM track must come first.

  </p>
  <p><b>Editorial:</b> This first level error correction (the only type used for CD Audio data)
    is extremely powerful. The CD specification allows for discs to have up to 220 raw errors per
    second. Every one of these errors is (almost always) perfectly corrected by the CIRC scheme
    for a net error rate of zero. For example, our tests using Apple's CD-ROM drive (which also
    plays audio) show that raw error rates are around 50-100 per second these days. Of course,
    these are perfectly corrected, meaning that the original data is perfectly recovered. We have
    tested flawed discs with raw rates up to 300 per second. Net errors on all of these discs?
    Zero! I would expect a typical audio CD player to perform similarly. Thus I expect this raw
    error rate to have no audible consequences.

  </p>
  <p>So why did I say "almost always" corrected above? Because a sufficiently bad flaw may
    produce uncorrectable errors. These very unusual errors are "concealed" by the player rather
    than corrected. Note that this concealment is likely to be less noticeable than even a single
    scratch on an LP. Such a flaw might be a really opaque finger smudge; CDs do merit careful
    handling. On the two (and only two) occasions I have found these, I simply sprayed on a little
    Windex glass cleaner and wiped it off using radial strokes. This restored the CDs to zero net
    errors.

  </p>
  <p>One can argue about the quality of the process of conversion of analog music to and from
    digital representation, but in the digital domain CDs are really very, very good.

  </p>
  <p></p>
  <h3>CD-ROM Data Tracks</h3>

  <p>Each CD-ROM data track is divided into individually addressable blocks of 2352 data bytes,
    i.e. one subcoding block or 98 frames. A header in each block contains the block address and
    the mode of the block. The block address is identical to the encoding of minute, second, and
    frame number in subcode channel Q. The modes defined in the CD-ROM specification are:

  </p>
  <dl>
    <dt> Mode 0:
    </dt>
    <dd> All data bytes are zero.<p>

      </p>
    </dd>
    <dt> Mode 1 (CD-ROM Data):
    </dt>
    <dd>
      <ul>
        <li> Sync Field - 12 bytes
        </li>
        <li> Header Field - 4
        </li>
        <li> User Data Field - 2048
        </li>
        <li> Error Detection Code - 4
        </li>
        <li> Reserved - 8
        </li>
        <li> Error Correction - 276
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>

      </p>
    </dd>
    <dt> Mode 2 (CD Audio or Other Data):
    </dt>
    <dd>
      <ul>
        <li> Sync Field - 12 bytes
        </li>
        <li> Header Field - 4
        </li>
        <li> User Data Field - 2048
        </li>
        <li> Auxiliary Data Field - 288
        </li>
      </ul>
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>Thus, mode 1 defines separately addressable, physical 2K byte data blocks making CD-ROM
    look at this level very similar to other digital mass storage devices.

  </p>
  <p></p>
  <h3>Second Level Error Correction</h3>

  <p>An uncorrected error in audio data typically results in a brief, often inaudible click
    during listening at worst. An uncorrected error in other kinds of data, for example program
    code, may render a CD unusable. For this reason, CD-ROM defines a second level of error
    detection and error correction (EDC/ECC) for mode 1 data. The information for the EDC/ECC
    occupies most of the auxiliary data field.

  </p>
  <p>The error detection code is a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) on the sync, header, and user
    data. It occupies the first four bytes of the auxiliary data field and provides a very high
    probability that uncorrected errors will be detected. The error correction code is essentially
    the same as the first level error correction in that interleaving and Reed-Solomon coding are
    used. It occupies the final 276 bytes of the auxiliary data field.

  </p>
  <p><b>Editorial:</b> This extra level of error correction for CD-ROM blocks is one of the many
    reasons that CD-ROM drives are much more expensive than consumer audio players. To perform
    this error correction quickly requires substantial extra computing power (sometimes a
    dedicated microprocessor) in the drive.

  </p>
  <p>This is also one reason that consumer players like the Magnavoxes which claim to be CD-ROM
    compatible (with their digital output jack on the back) are useless for that purpose. They
    have no way of dealing with the CD-ROM error correction. They also have no way for a computer
    to tell them where to seek.

  </p>
  <p>Another reason that CD-ROM drives are more expensive is that they are built to be a
    computer peripheral rather than a consumer device, i.e. like a combination race car/truck
    rather than a family sedan. One story, probably apocryphal but not far from the truth, has
    it that a major Japanese manufacturer tested some consumer audio players to simulate computer
    use: they made them seek (move the optical head) from the inside of the CD to the outside and
    back again. These are called maximum seeks. The story says they managed to do this for about
    24 hours before they broke down. A CD-ROM drive needs to be several orders of magnitude more
    robust. Fast and strong don't come cheap.

  </p>
  <p></p>
  <h3>The High Sierra File System Standard</h3>

  <p>Built on top of the addressable 2K blocks that the CD-ROM specification defines, the next
    higher level of data encoding is a file system that permits logical organization of the data
    on the CD. This can be a native file system like the Macintosh Hierarchical File System (HFS).
    Another alternative is the High Sierra (also known as the ISO 9660) file standard, recently
    approved by the National Information Standards Organization (NISO) and the International
    Standards Organization (ISO), which defines a file system carefully tuned to CD
    characteristics. In particular:

  </p>
  <dl>
    <dt> 1. CDs have modest seek time and high capacity.
    </dt>
    <dd> As a result, the High Sierra standard makes trade-offs that reduce the number of seeks
      needed to read a file at the expense of space efficiency.

    </dd>
    <dt> 2. CDs are read-only.
    </dt>
    <dd> Thus, concerns like space allocation, file deletion, and the like are not addressed in
      the specification.
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>For High Sierra file systems, each individual CD is a volume. Several CDs may be grouped
    together in a volume set and there is a mechanism for subsequent volumes in a set to update
    preceding ones. Volumes can contain standard file structures, coded character set file
    structures for character encoding other than ASCII, or boot records. Boot records can contain
    either data or program code that may be needed by systems or applications.

  </p>
  <p></p>
  <h3>High Sierra Directories and Files</h3>

  <p>The file system is a hierarchical one in which directories may contain files or other
    directories. Each volume has a root directory which serves as an ancestor to all other
    directories or files in the volume. This dictates an overall tree structure for the volume.

  </p>
  <p>A typical disadvantage in hierarchical systems is that to read a file (which must be a
    leaf of the hierarchy tree) given its full path name, it is necessary to begin at the root
    directory and search through each of its ancestral directories until the entry for the file
    is found. For example, given the path name "Wine Regions:America:California:Mendocino", three
    directories (the first three components of the path name) would need to be searched.
    Typically, a separate seek would be required for each directory. This would result in
    relatively poor performance.

  </p>
  <p>To avoid this, High Sierra specifies that each volume contain a path table in addition to
    its directories and files. The path table describes the directory hierarchy in a compact form
    that may be cached in computer memory for optimum performance. The path table contains entries
    for the volume's directories in a breadth-first order; directories with a common parent are
    listed in lexicographic order. Each entry contains only the location of the directory it
    describes, its name, and the location in the path table of its parent. This mechanism allows
    any directory to be accessed with only a single CD seek.

  </p>
  <p>Directories contain more detailed information than the path table. Each directory entry
    contains:

  </p>
  <ul>
    <li> Directory or file location.
    </li>
    <li> File length.
    </li>
    <li> Date and time of creation.
    </li>
    <li> Name of the file.
    </li>
    <li> Flags:
      <ul>
        <li> Whether the entry is for a file or a directory.
        </li>
        <li> Whether or not it is an associated file.
        </li>
        <li> Whether or not it has records.
        </li>
        <li> Whether or not it has read protection.
        </li>
        <li> Whether or not it has subsequent extents.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li> Interleave structure of the file.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Interleaving may be used, for example, to meet realtime requirements for multiple files
    whose contents must be presented simultaneously. This would happen if a file containing
    graphic images were interleaved with a file containing compressed sound that describes the
    images.

  </p>
  <p>Files themselves are recorded in contiguous (or interleaved) blocks on the disc. The
    read-only nature of CD permits this contiguous recording in a straightforward manner. A file
    may also be recorded in a series of noncontiguous extents with a directory entry for each
    extent.

  </p>
  <p>The specification does not favor any particular computer architecture. In particular all
    significant, multibyte numbers are recorded twice, once with the most significant byte first
    and once with the least significant byte first.

  </p>
  <p></p>
  <h3>Multimedia Information</h3>

  <p>Using the file system are applications that create and portray multimedia information.
    While it is true that a CD can store anything that a magnetic disk can store (and usually
    much more of it), CDs will be used more for storing information than for storing programs.
    It is the very large storage capacity of CDs coupled with their low cost that opens up the
    possibilities for interactive, multimedia information to be used in a multitude of ways.

  </p>
  <p>Programs like HyperCard, with it's ease of authoring and broad extensibility, are very
    useful for this purpose. Hypercard stacks, with related information such as color images and
    sound, can be easily and inexpensively stored on CDs despite their possibly very large size.

  </p>
  <p><b>Editorial:</b> The High Sierra file system gets its name from the location of the first
    meeting on it: the High Sierra Hotel at Lake Tahoe. It is much more commonly referred to as
    ISO 9660, though the two specifications are slightly different.

  </p>
  <p>It has gotten very easy and inexpensive to make a CD-ROM disc (or audio CD). For example,
    you can now take a Macintosh hard disk and send it with $1500 to one of several CD pressers.
    They will send you back your hard disk and 100 CDs with exactly the same content as what's on
    your disk. This is the easy way to make CDs with capacity up to the size of your hard disk
    (Apple's go up to 160 megabytes). True, this is not a full CD but CDs don't need to be full.
    If you have just 10 megabytes and need 100 copies, CDs may be the best way to go.

  </p>
  <p>If you are buying a CD-ROM drive, there are several factors you might consider in making
    your choice. Two factors NOT to consider are capacity and data rate. The capacity of all
    CD-ROM drives is determined solely by the CD they are reading. Though you will see a range of
    numbers in manufacturers' specs (e.g. 540, 550, 600, and 650 Mbytes), any drive can read any
    disc and so they are all fundamentally the same. All CD-ROM drives read data at a net 150
    Kbytes/sec for CD-ROM data. Other data rates you may see may include error correction data
    (not included in the net rate) or may be a mode 2 data rate (faster than mode 1). All drives
    will be the same in all of these specs.

    <h2>Ring In The New Year!</h2>
  </a>
  <p>
    <i>by Christine Cabreros</i>

  </p>
  <p>It began as a simple group of people getting together to watch some movies. Things began
    to change, subtly at first then it became apparent that something was amiss. The rain outside
    was making loud pattering noises as if... there were someone or something on the roof. The
    winds outside howled through the trees. Branches nearby were whistling and scratching at the
    windows. There were pizza boxes and empty pop cans littered around the room which gave a
    feeling of some great feast. The silence in the room was so heavy with dread that not even
    the students in the room could hear themselves breathing.

  </p>
  <p>Suddenly, a scream escapes from a throat torn by an elvish sword. "Elf friends!!!!!
    Aggghh!!!!" The room was filled with a light so bright people were squinting at the TV just
    to find out what would happen next. It became an all out attack as the again hungry humans
    took out their swords, axes and other weapons to converge upon the unsuspecting pizza bearer.
    Without a dollar being exchanged, the pizza bearer was beheaded and the pizzas were quickly
    divided and more drink was consumed by the slobbering, munching ravenous creatures of the
    dark night. As the fighting stopped and the blood ceased to flow, the appetites of the hoards
    were soon forgotten.

  </p>
  <p>The first of the three movies ended and thus began `The Lord of the Rings'. The crowd was
    a little restless because the loud Hobbitses were singing again. Edgy hands were slowly
    inching towards their weapons. It was unbelievable. Hobbitses constantly singing. Soon there
    was a misstep and the singing hobbit disappears. Now the screams of delight became screams
    of horror, bringing the evil riders of Sauron. The crowd was so engrossed they didn't notice
    the sound of slippery feet following the escape of the last piece of pizza in the hands of
    the thief.

  </p>
  <p>At first glance into the, now, indistinguishable room, you would see dried blood and dead
    bodies strewn all over. But look, in the dark recess is a group of survivors hoping that the
    huge battle of elves, humans and hobbits against the trolls, goblins and other evil creatures
    will end. The battle still rages on the video screen as the two wee Hobbitses Frodo and
    Sam-wise move ever onward.

  </p>
  <p>This time the blinding light comes from the door as an eager but humble creature calls
    out,"No more pizza!". Then quickly hurries out the door before the night creatures could
    respond in kind. The screen then goes blank. At this time, having the distressing news of no
    more food, the happy and not so angered humans decide to make their exit from the now
    foodless room to find other pleasures in the night.

  </p>
  <p>Here, we start the next movie `Return of the King' with a smaller set of people. Frodo
    has been captured and is being tortured by an evil goblin. There's hush in the room and a
    raging storm outside as the ring casts its wicked spell over the bewildered Sam-wise, giving
    him illusions of grandeur. The pop is slowly guzzled away into the remaining watchers. Little
    rats scurry here and there in the hopes to finding what remains of the devouring pizza eaters
    meal. There are tiny squeals as a rat ventures near a seeming sleeping hand and is caught.
    Another war rages on as the valiant fight evil hordes of creatures. The weather outside has
    seemingly died down. There were no more sounds of whistling branches or of the howling winds
    as the sun broke through the dark mists that hovered over the silent and not so crowded room.
    A bard starts to sing of the battles and middle earth is safe from the grip of evil. For
    Frodo has destroyed the one ring with the help of the thief with the flippers for feet.

  </p>
  <p>This ends the tale of the movie night as witnessed by Christine Cabreros.

  </p>
  <p>[P.S. Thanks to all the students that made it out this night. It was another successful
    movie night. There are a lot of Tolkien fans out there. Good Luck with the Tolkien Trivia
    found elsewhere in the Wisdom!!!!]

  </p>
  <p>If you have any ideas for a theme drop by LT 5108 and leave a suggestion with an
    executive or if you have any suggestions in general for activities.

  </p>
  <p>The next movie night will be in March. Hope to see you there!!!!

  <p>Well once again another issue of the Wisdom is out. As usual we're always looking for
    people who would like to submit articles (you get $5.00). Anyone who would like to submit
    an article can do so by e-mail (wisdom@cs.uwindsor.ca) or by hard copy at the office
    (LT 5108).

  </p>
  <p>Due to the date of printing, we weren't able to get an article on the ski trip to Alpine
    Valley. The weather was beautiful and everyone had fun. Look for an account of what happened
    and for photos in the next issue!

  </p>
  <p>We hope you like the article on CD ROM technology (found on the Internet). CD ROMs have
    been around for a while now but not many people know much about the technologyl. Many
    companies (like SUN) is distributing almost all of it's new software on CDs now and other
    companies (such as IBM, SGI, DEC etc.) are following suite.

  </p>
  <p>Well, that's it for space, so bye!
