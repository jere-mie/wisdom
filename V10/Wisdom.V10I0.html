    <h2> function Social (char: "Dean Scott");</h2>
  </a>

  <p> Welcome back students and studentettes. By now the summer has just about
    finished its' blistering assault on us and it's time to start thinking about
    putting in some long study hours. I'm Dean Scott and I'm your V.P. of Social
    Functions. I'll be trying to break up the monotony with a few activities.
    Hopefully, you will be able to attend most of these outings. Take note of the
    CEDAR POINT trip. I want a good turnout!

  </p>
  <p> As usual, I welcome any suggestions you may have about student functions,
    how I may represent your interests in certain society issues, and can be contacted
    by E-mail at SCOTT2@uwindsor, or by phone at the society office or at home
    (254-6126).

  </p>
  <p> We, as a student collective, must keep up to date with issues that concern out
    future. We plan to have informative and accurate articles in the wisdom as well as
    fun and games. Questions are urged and will be answered.

  </p>
  <p> Again, we are here for you. We want to help in any way possible (except
    cheating of course). In the same respect, we ask that you do your part to make
    this a productive year for your fellow students.

  </p>
  <p> Enjoy your classes and remember the fun has just begun!

  </p>
  <p> I am your vice president of academic affairs for the computer science society
    and am here to look into problems you might have with your courses. I have also
    been put in charge of heading up the committee for application advancement. The
    primary goal for this committee will be to find a way to provide more applications
    on the SGI. Any suggestions for applications that you would like to see on the SGI
    would be appreciated. A new internet tool has been added to the system, it is
    called Xmosaic and is at /usr/local/cs/bin/sgi/xmosaic.

  </p>
  <p> Xmosaic is a World-Wide Web browser that provides a hypertext interface to all
    internet on-line information. Access to most internet facilities can be found in
    the pull down menu Documents. Links are marked as underlined text and can be
    selected by pointing and clicking. I encourage everyone interested in the internet
    to try this out. An article on the WWW will be coming by me in the next edition of
    the Wisdom. Any questions about your courses, the World-Wide Web or the internet
    in general can be E-mailed to me at markham@server.uwindsor.ca.

    <h2>Happy 10th Birthday, C.S.S. !</h2>
  </a>
  <p>
    <i>by Alain Siodlowski</i>

  </p>
  <p> Yes, it's been 10 years that the Computer Science Society has been in
    existence. For those of you who are new CS students here, here is a brief
    description of what the C.S.S. is. We are here as the voice of CS students
    during meetings of the School of Computer Science and also S.A.C. meetings.
    We voice the concerns of the students to the Proffs and the student council and
    we bring back information to the students as to what's going on. We also help
    students in need of info (what classes to take, what software to buy, what
    computer to buy and where, etc.). Granted we are not professionals in any of
    these fields, but as fellow students we can help you with our experience or
    refer you to someone who knows more.

  </p>
  <p> On of the functions that we place high priority here at the C.S.S. is that
    of having fun and meeting people. We organize a lot of activities ranging from
    the small and simple like the Looney Movie Nights to the big activities such as
    the trip to Cedar Point and the Ski trip in January. The point is that there is
    more to being a CS student in University than studying and doing homework. Our
    activities are lots of fun but not expensive. The most popular is the Looney Movie
    Night. The concept is simple: pizza, pop and 3 movies (usually relating to a theme)
    all the incredibly low price of only $1.00 (hence the Looney in Looney Movie
    Night). We're trying for about 3 such nights for this semester. If you have any
    suggestions for a theme, come and see us.

  </p>
  <p> Other activities include pool tournaments, volley-ball and of course the C.S.S.
    general meeting. The general meeting consists of two parts: the first is the actual
    meeting where you can find out about what is going on and voice your opinions about
    us, the School of Computer Science and the University. The second part takes place
    at a local drinking hole where pizza and "refreshments" are serves all night long
    and everyone has a good time. The cost: NOTHING, it's paid through your society
    fees, so join us. The date, time and location of the meeting will be announced in
    classes (when we decide on a time, date and place).

  </p>
  <p> Also, before I run out of room, the newsletter Wisdom is open to all CSS
    members. If you would like to write an article relating to Computer Science,
    technology or life at the University, see me at the office or E-Mail me the
    article at this address: siodlow@server.uwindsor.ca. All articles are welcomed
    and pays $5.00 per published article!

  </p>
  <p> If you have any suggestions about the Wisdom or anything else the Computer
    Science Society does, come and see us! We're always open to new ideas.

    <h2>So You Want To Be a Computer Scientist , Eh ?</h2>
  </a>
  <p>
    <i> by Ron McKenzie</i>

  </p>
  <p> Well, as the President of the Computer Science Society, I'm sure you're not
    surprised to hear that I think you've made the right choice. If you play you're
    cards right you'll be on your way to an interesting and satisfying career. Looking
    back from my last year of an Honours degree there are a few things I wished I
    would have figured out earlier, listed in no particular order.

  </p>
  <dl>
    <dt> C.S. students are not a bunch of Computer-geeks.
    </dt>
    <dd> This is a very common
      misconception. I bet if we asked 100 students, from various programs, to describe
      the typical C.S. student, it wouldn't be a pretty picture. It's common image
      as T.V. and Film, the computer-nerd. Oh sure, there are plenty of counter-examples,
      but we tend to remember the funnier ones. I recall my attitude in first and second
      year. The idea that my friend in C.S. and myself were somehow unique, set apart
      from the rest. We knew we did not fit the computer-geek image, but still believed
      society's image. Going to Computer Science Society events is probably the best way
      to clarify this misconception. Not because we are in any way different, but just
      being around a large collection of C.S. students you'll realize we're just regular
      people.
      <p>

      </p>
    </dd>
    <dt> You are not going to be taught everything you need to know about computers in
      school.
    </dt>
    <dd> I'm not sure everyone fully realizes this one. Well, I mean most people
      in 3rd or 4th year realize there are things they've had to learn or they're own or
      not at all, but it's no small amount of stuff. The program is getting better
      however. One improvement is that C.S. students can now take one of 60-104, 60-105,
      or 60 - 204 for credit. When I started we wouldn't take any of them. As a result
      we've had a lot of people graduate who could program a database, but didn't know
      how to use DBase. It's important to know how to use programs that are commonly
      used in business. There are other things I feel are very important, but you
      probably won't be taught. The first, small group dynamics. As it stand 60-393
      &amp; 60-394 are the only courses where you work as a group. Being able to work well in
      a group is a very important skill in business today. The faculty is aware if this,
      and is trying to provide more exposure in this area. The last is up to you.
      Staying current with technology. The best way is to read computer magazines. It's
      not hard to do, usually they are rather interesting, and they help keep you up to
      date. There are other things that you are expected to pick-up on your own, a good
      example is new languages. Some courses are taught in languages, you don't know.
      Sometimes they won't teach the language, simply expect you to pick it up. This does
      help you learn to be independent and motivate yourself.
      <p>

      </p>
    </dd>
    <dt> Knowing your stuff is not always enough.
    </dt>
    <dd> Otherwise known as "<i>the game</i>". I play the game fairly well, but I'm
      not the best at it. "<i>The game</i>" consists of figuring
      out what the professor wants and will give marks for, then doing it. I think
      learning the material should come first. Once you've done this, or while you are
      doing it, ask yourself what kind of questions will be on the next test. Most Proffs
      are fairly consistent. A good way to figure out what type of questions to expect
      is to find a copy of last year's test, if they taught the same course. For a long
      time I thought what they did in class or on assignments would be a good
      **indication of what to expect on a test. Unfortunately, all to often it's not.
      some Proffs do however. The key is to get to know the Proff. The first mid-term is
      usually the best way. This also can be misleading. For example, one class last
      year, the first mid-term was all applied. The second had some theory, the final
      had way too much theory. "<i>The game</i>" is far from infallible but it helps your
      mark reflect your actual knowledge (sometimes higher).
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>Hopefully my insights are of some use to someone. Best of luck.

    <h2>Now You're Playing With Power</h2>
  </a>
  <p>
    <i>by Ron McKenzie</i>

  </p>
  <p> Wow, I never expected the President of the Computer Science Society to be a
    Nintendo addict. Well, I'm not. PowerPC is what I'm talking (writing about). I'd
    assume, possibly incorrectly, that you know nothing about the PowerPC. I don't
    plan to explain it here, only make you more familiar. Ok. The PowerPc 601, or
    MPC 601, is the first CPU created by the IBM/Apple/Motorola alliance. For
    starters, it is a 32-bit, 66Mhz, RISC processor that costs half as much as a
    Pentium and runs on average 2-3 times faster. Ah, but there is the eternal
    question. Can it run all my DOS software? Yes it can, but it will do so via
    software emulation. The problem with emulation of course is it doesn't run at
    native speed, and some software simply will not run. They expect the emulation
    to run at 486 levels, which to me isn't too shabby at all. But not only can it run
    DOS, it is expected to run windows software as fast as a Quandra 700 and native
    Unix as fast a as Sun SparcStation 10.

  </p>
  <p> The MPC601 is already in production. The IBM/Apple/Motorola alliance has 3
    other CPU's stated for release in `94. The MPC603 which will be a power-saver for
    notebook computers. The MPC604 which will be their performance model of the 601.
    Then there's the MPC620 which will be designed for high-end workstations and
    servers. I am predicting a war between the PowerPC and the Pentium (not a real
    out-on-the-limb sort of prediction). I honestly hope neither side wins. Monopolies
    aren't good for anyone, they drive prices up and performance down. Let's compare
    the two:

  </p>
  <p> <b>PowerPC vs Pentium</b>

  </p>
  <dl>
    <dt> Multiprocessing
    </dt>
    <dd> Both are designed for use in symetric multiprocessing systems.
      <p>

      </p>
    </dd>
    <dt> Power Consumption
    </dt>
    <dd> At 66Mhz Pentium needs 16w while PowerPC need only 9w. As a result PowerPc
      will run a lot cooler.
      <p>

      </p>
    </dd>
    <dt> Native SW Base
    </dt>
    <dd> Although PowerPC can run almost anything, native code will always run faster.
      The Pentium has a horde of native code at it's disposal.
      <p>

      </p>
    </dd>
    <dt> Cost
    </dt>
    <dd> In quantities of 1000, Pentium costs about $965 US, compared to about $450 for
      an MPC 601 in the same quantities.
      <p>

      </p>
    </dd>
    <dt> Performance
    </dt>
    <dd> Early benchmarks show the PowerPC performing 1 to 5 times better, depending on
      the aplication.
      <p>

      </p>
    </dd>
    <dt> Market acceptance
    </dt>
    <dd> Pentium has that warm blanket kind of feel about it. It will run all of your
      present Intel-based software faster than ever. Safe and comfortable.
      <p>

      </p>
    </dd>
    <dt> Expandability
    </dt>
    <dd> Intel has gotten to the point where you can just pop out the old CPU and pop
      in a new one. There has been no mention of any expansion possibilities. They have
      however announced 3 other CPUs for release in `94 .
      <p>

      </p>
    </dd>
    <dt> Peripheral Compatability
    </dt>
    <dd> There is no garentee that all of your peripherals will be fully compatible
      with the new PowerPC .
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <p> Up until early august I was convinced that the next computer I buy was going
    to be a Pentium based machine. Now, I seriosly doubt it. I do have one serious
    concern about the IBM/Apple/Motorola alliance. IBM/Apple/Motorola is just too long
    to say . Soon they will be called IAM. How long? How long I ask? How long before
    they, or more properly their machine ( You know they will only trust people in
    charge for so long ) is calling itself " I AM " . Now, doesn't this conjure images
    of an Intellegent computer that takes over the world and forces all mankind into
    slavery . Hmmm ....

  </p>
  <p> For further information on the PowerPC I recommend reading the the August
    edition of the Byte magazine.

  </a>

  <p> Hello! This is your new President, Ron McKenzie. Welcome to the Society, all
    you first year students, and welcome back all you repeat offenders. I hope you all
    had a great summer. If you're anything like me, you look forward to coming back to
    school as much as you look forward to having a root canal. Well, now that we're
    here, we might as well enjoy it. Which is basically the whole philosophy behind
    the Computer Science Society. Ok. Ok. Ok. I realize how that sounds to most of
    the first year, and probably half of the second year students out there. "Gee a
    bunch of computer geeks hanging around talking about bits and bytes. "(Oh joy...
    ya great... oh, oh, please... please restrain me). Well if you're gonna by into
    the image that the media feeds you about computer scientists, you're in for a
    rough go.

  </p>
  <p> Those who don't believe me, come out to one of our events, but don't be
    surprised when you find real people there. Hmmm, where was I, oh ya, the whole
    philosophy bit. school's a hard pill to swallow, we just help it go down easier.
    Well, some of you will come to believe me, some will never know.

  </p>
  <p> For those who don't already know, just by being in Computer Science you're in
    the Computer Science Society. You've already paid $10 of your tuition to us. Anyone
    who comes out to one quarter of our events will find their money well spent.

  </p>
  <p> About the Exec; we are all voted into office, don't get paid one red cent, are
    fairly dedicated, reasonably approachable, and are always willing to listen to new
    ideas. Make a point of stopping by the office some time during the first week of
    school.

  </p>
  <p> At the time this newsletter went to print, we don't have an exact room number,
    but we will be somewhere in the new University Centre (UC), but we'll announce that
    in your classes. (Maybe we already did.) Well, regardless fo your Society
    involvement, hope you have a GREAT YEAR!!

    <h2>YOU'D BETTER READ THIS ...</h2>
  </a>

  <p> `ello, `ello and welcome. That was for the new people in Computer Science (CS).
    Guess what? You are back. That was for the not-so-new people returning this
    semester. I hope every body enjoyed their summer, no matter what they did.

  </p>
  <p> Well, now you are probably wondering who the heck am I? For those of you who
    asked themselves that question, I would like to inform you that you are going to
    regret it, because I am going to answer. But before I answer, I have a question to
    ask those who asked themselves that question: Do you mean who I am in general (as a
    person)? Who I am in relation to CS (i.e. why the heck am I writing this and why
    are you wasting your time reading it)? Or did you just ask to be polite?

  </p>
  <p> For the first group, I will tell some things about myself, the rest you will
    have to find out for yourselves (hopefully by getting to know me better). For the
    second group, I have a detailed answer for you below. And for the last group, I
    have one thing to say to you: TOUGH, because I'll tell you anyway.

  </p>
  <p> My name is Zina Aljanabi. Nobody calls me Ms. Aljanabi. They think that it's a
    mouth-full, but it really isn't. If you think my last name is a mouth-full, what
    would you call "Siodlowski" (our editor's last name)? {Editor's note: I would call
    it a very nice name} I can probably go on about that last name thing. But I won't.
    So, in short, just call me Zina. Up until last semester (Winter/93), I really was
    only partially into computer science. You see, in my first year at the University,
    I couldn't get the art course that I wanted, since all the sections were full, so
    I took the TURING course with Dr. Kent as an elective. It was really suppose to be
    only a one time thing. But, the unexpected happened. I got hooked on computer science!

  </p>
  <p> From that semester on, I kept taking the odd computer science course until
    most of my option courses were from the faculty of computer science. By the time
    the second year of university came around, I declared that I am double majoring
    in Business &amp; Computer Science. That is not to say that in one year I knew all I
    needed to know about CS to commit myself to it. Actually, I now know quite a bit
    about computers, BUT compared to the other guys on the society, I am really a
    novice when it comes down to "computers". Now, I have just graduated from Business,
    and I am and totally in computer science.

  </p>
  <p> Now that you all know my background, you probably want to know what do I have
    to do with the society. Oh-uh, did I forget to mention that I hold the position of
    V.P. Without Portfolio on the society? Oh dear, I probably did. Oh well, now you
    know. I am the V.P. Without Portfolio. A wonderful name is it not? The name was
    one of the reasons I wanted this position. The other reason was the fact that
    nobody else was running against me for it.

  </p>
  <p> My job, for those of you who can't tell just by the name of the position, is
    basically that of a third year Rep. , in addition to handling communication with
    other societies. Now who would've thought that the V.P. Without Portfolio mean
    that? I would like you to keep in mind that myself and every other member of the
    society are here to help you, and even if you don't need any help then it always
    helps to talk to somebody who has been through the same things you are going
    through, and believe me we all have.

  </p>
  <p> So, is anyone has any questions, comments, or cries of anguish, then come up
    to the fifth floor, LT room 5108, and talk to one of us. Somebody will always be
    there during office hours, so you'll always find someone to chat with.

  </p>
  <p> Well, now that I've said all that, I hope you all have a good semester.

  </p>
  <p> See you around... Zina.
