    <i>by Dean T. Scott</i>

  </p>
  <p>Welcome back all ye carolers of the Holidays! I hope
    you all enjoyed yourselves and had aspirin on hand. I
    had a great Christmas but was sick for my New Years
    Party. I'll wait while you dry your eyes.

  </p>
  <p>OK, continuing... We're all looking forward to lots of
    work in the new year... well the movie night anyway;
    and the executives are planning various other releases
    for your programming frustration. Movie nights (<i>STAR
      WARS TRIOLOGY</i>), a pool tournament and volleyball
    should be a good start.

  </p>
  <p>If you have not had a chance to meet our new
    professor I suggest you take the time. Her name is Dr.
    Mounia Lalmas and she is anxious to meet the
    students. It's nice to see that the new prof can talk to
    people on their level and take the time to answer
    questions even before she is offering a course. I think
    that she is a positive addition to our faculty staff.

  </p>
  <p>On behalf of the students and executive staff,
    WELCOME! Dr. Lalmas will be
    teaching the Software Development
    courses next September for those
    interested, and these courses along
    with a few other requirements will
    make up a new Honours degree in
    Computer Science. Well, why are
    you still reading this, get going!!!
    Have a great year and keep the
    marks HIGH.

    <h2>FTP And The Internet</h2>
  </a>
  <p>
    <i>by Ralph Markham</i>

  </p>
  <p>The Internet has a variety of useful resources. There
    are thousands of files available to you, if you know how
    to access them. The first thing to look at is transferring
    files. FTP (File Transfer Protocol) and FSP are used to
    transfer files. FSP is not a widely supported protocol, a
    good number of the archives that support FSP are a
    little more shady than those that support FTP. The
    there is no public FSP server on the SGI or the SUN,
    servers can be found at tp.robots.ox.ac.uk in "/pub/
    ox.src/" using FTP. FTP is supported on both the SGI
    and SUN and can be used to access a huge number of
    public archives from which almost all information on
    your local bbs has originated. There are a number of
    basic commands you need to know the are as follows:

  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <dl>
    <dt> <b>ascii</b>
    </dt>
    <dd> Sets the transfer mode to 7 bit for text files

    </dd>
    <dt> <b>binary </b>
    </dt>
    <dd> Sets the transfer mode to 8 bit for binary files

    </dd>
    <dt> <b>cd</b>
    </dt>
    <dd> Changes the working directory on the remote
      machine

    </dd>
    <dt> <b>get</b>
    </dt>
    <dd> Retrieves the specified file. Note: remember to
      set the correct transfer mode using
      ascii or binary.

    </dd>
    <dt> <b>put</b>
    </dt>
    <dd> Puts the specified file on the
      remote machine

    </dd>
    <dt> <b>mget</b>
    </dt>
    <dd> Multiple file get, the same as
      get except you may use wild
      characters or a list of files.

    </dd>
    <dt> <b>mput </b>
    </dt>
    <dd> Multiple file put, the same as
      put except you may use wild
      characters or a list of files.

    </dd>
    <dt> <b>prompt</b>
    </dt>
    <dd> Toggles prompting on or off when mget or mput are used.

    </dd>
    <dt> <b>bye</b>
    </dt>
    <dd> Ends the ftp session.

  <p> Some of the problems you might run into.

  </p>
  <p>Q. you downloaded the file and it doesn't work

  </p>
  <p>A. download it again but make sure you enter "binary" first, to specify binary
    transfer mode.

  </p>
  <p>Q. you only get half a file or the transfer cuts out before its finished.

  </p>
  <p>A. This is probably due to your disk space quota and all you should need to
    remedy this is to make a directory in the /tmp directory and download the files
    there.

  </p>
  <p> Getting your programs off the system can be done in one of two ways at
    home using kermit (i.e. kermit -i -s bin.file.name, kermit -s text.file.name) or at
    the computer center using the 486's.

  </p>
  <p> On another note you may have found that certain news groups which are
    not available on the system like <i>alt.fan.?????</i>. Although these news groups
    are not on the system it does not mean that you can not get them. Try looking
    in the following ftp sites under the path /pub/usenet/news.group.name:
    <i>pit-manager.edu</i> or <i>ftp.sunet.se</i>. If you have an fsp server you
    can also find them at 131.215.131.148 21.

  </p>
  <p> Another way to transfer files is to use e-mail, this can be used for both
    binary and text. Special preparation of binary files is needed, each binary file
    must be encoded using uuencode (e.g. uuencode file.name). Similarly the
    receiver must decode the file using uudecode (e.g. uudecode file.name).

  </p>
  <p>For those of you who are interested in the internet and would like to know
    more I strongly recommend "The Whole Internet User's Guide &amp; Catalog" by
    Ed Krol which I believe is still available in the University book store.

    <h2>Pentium Power</h2>
  </a>
  <p>
    <i>by: Ursula Bagnell </i>

  </p>
  <p>For all you people that were in 60-
    100 and heard Dr. Frost refer to that
    `pentium chip' and had no clue about
    what he was referring to. This article
    is for you!

  </p>
  <p>There is a new source of
    computing power which has been
    discovered. It can amazingly
    execute two instructions at once.
    This incredible chip can produce
    processing speeds of over 100 MIPS
    (millions of instructions per second).
    It is called the Pentium. by Intel. This
    article will briefly explain how its
    technology is making PCs run faster
    today.

  </p>
  <p>In General there are three ways in
    which to make microprocessors run
    faster:

  </p>
  <dl>
    <dt><b>Increase the number of
        transistors on a chip.</b>

    </dt>
    <dd>Using submicron components
      enables designers to fit over 3
      million transistors on a single chip.
      This allows designers to add
      components, for example math co-
      processors and caches right onto
      the CPU, considerably cutting
      access time.

      <p>
      </p>
    </dd>
    <dt><b>Increase the clock speed.</b>

    </dt>
    <dd>Not to long ago (say 12 years) the
      clock speed ticked along at an
      extremely slow rate of 4.7 MHz. Now
      with new technology they can run at
      an astonishing 66 MHz -- and they
      are still striving for more.

      <p>
      </p>
    </dd>
    <dt><b>Increase the number of
        executions per clock cycle.</b>

    </dt>
    <dd>Now with new superscalar
      technology, processors are now
      capable of executing two
      instructions per clock cycle.
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>These features, help the Pentium
    processor crunch more than 100
    MIPS at a clock speed of 60 MHz.
    Pentium processor based PCs are
    now as fast as workstations. Yes that
    means that it can perform 2 times
    better than the Intel 486 DX2 66
    MHz processor. Also, the
    redesigned floating-point unit on the
    Pentium processor offers up to 5
    times the performance of the Intel
    486DX2-66 CPU for math-intensive
    applications.

  </p>
  <p>This pentium processor allows
    programmers to broaden their
    horizons in the software industry,
    such as 3-D design, multimedia,
    handwriting and voice recognition,
    virtual reality and more.

    <h2>Violence in Software</h2>
    <i>by Dean T Scott</i>

    <p>You've seen it on the TV news, in the paper and possibly the radio morning
      show, violence in software is creating waves of debate. Mortal Combat, Doom
      and Death Trap along with many other titles of popular games are among the
      headlines. These games are available for games systems such as SEGA,
      Super Nintendo, and also some for the home PC. Many groups are upset at
      the gruesome acts of savagery portrayed in the games.

    </p>
    <p>Mortal Combat is just as the name suggests, the combatants use various
      fighting techniques to fell their opponent and every character has special
      moves. This in itself is not too bad. The blood that is shown when a player is
      hit adds effective energy to the game; but is it too much. The real problem
      occurs in the DEATH MOVES. When a player is almost beaten and can barely
      stand their aggressor is told to FINISH HIM. At this point the heart may be
      ripped out, the head with the spine still attached can be held as a trophy, or
      the player may be burnt to a crisp and their bones crumble. These are just the
      more gory kills.

    </p>
    <p>SEGA uses a special code on the games for parents to monitor what their
      children buy. It is much like the movie ratings. We all know how affective those
      are! Super Nintendo went as far as not programming in the blood and some of
      the end moves. On a positive side, SEGA has to have a code entered into the
      game to turn on blood and DEATH MOVES, but I received the code from a
      twelve year old when I was at work. When asked where he had obtained it he
      replied, "It's in all the game magazines at the bookstore." I checked and the
      magazines are accessible to all ages and not only book stores but at every
      convenience store you can possibly name.

    </p>
    <p>Doom is a game that has actually come far in its graphics enhancements if
      only in game play. The use of darkness and flashes of light when a gun is fired
      enhance game play dramatically and also instill fear in the player. I know. I
      have it. Out from under the covers now so I'll continue. You are basically on a
      moon base fighting aliens. You have a variety of weapons which cause the
      aliens to crumble in a pool of blood. Parts of their body explode and if you are
      lucky enough to own a sound card you can hear the screams of pain. One
      thing to remember that these are graphical aliens who are being killed and not
      people as in Mortal Combat. Even in Mortal Combat the characters are almost
      supernatural so the player is disassociated from the violence. The person is
      still not part of the game.

    </p>
    <p>Death Trap is a CD ROM game and employs real life actors and actresses
      to play roles in the game. The theme is zombi-like men attack women at a
      slumber party. Of course the girls are in lingerie and appear to be helpless.
      The main problem with this game is that the violence is so realistic and similar
      to today's social problems. Many experts agree that brutality against women
      on TV promotes the onslaught in real life. Games which also consist of such
      actions are no different in the fact that they have a negative impact on
      younger viewers, if not all viewers. It differs in the sense that the person
      playing the game has full control over the outcome, hence the life of another
      person. On TV we are just the spectators. That is bad enough. TV is highly
      censored and most sensitive issues or shows are on after eight PM. Parents
      watch the shows and see the warnings before viewing. Thus they can
      regulate what the child watches. Also, many parents do not realize what the
      games their children play actually consist of.

    </p>
    <p>Retail, unfortunately does not have strong enough regulations on who can
      buy what games, and they can be purchased anywhere. Children can rent the
      games from video stores and games stores. They are too accessible to
      young, impressionable people. Everyone is at odds for a solution to the
      problem. Some say to ban the games entirely, while others say to allow the
      parents to regulate their own children. No matter what the outcome, someone
      will be upset. I think that the games should be rented to persons of the
      appropriate age group. Utilizing the codes similar to that used by movie
      theaters and rental outlets. As long as the proprietor followed the rules then
      the problem could be minimized. Unfortunately I don't see the problem
      disappearing totally, but that would be a start. One thing is for sure though,
      Pac Man was too tame!

    <h2>Pirates Sunset</h2>
  </a>
  <p>
    <i>by Ron McKenzie</i>

  </p>
  <p>1993: The year of the CD-ROM. The year opened with the standard MPC-1
    compatible drives costing over $300 Cnd, and the newer MPC-2, or double-
    spin, drives costing as much as $1000. As we look ahead into 1994 we see a
    new batch of quad-spin drives coming out. First out of the gate was Pioneer,
    with it's DRM604X 6 disc quadraspin. NEC will be soon to follow with it's
    MultiSpin 4X Pro. Both of these drives will set you back over $1000, with the
    NEC drive doing less damage. These drives will be falling throughout the
    year, and driving down the price of the lesser drives. Already the prices on the
    double-spin drives are dipping as low as $300 Cnd.

  </p>
  <p>Now these falling prices will make drives more accessible, but this is nothing
    new. Bigger, faster, better, newer stuff driving down the prices of yesterday's
    technology. Rocketing performance and free-falling prices are standard fare in
    the computer industry. My concern is on the software end. Most significant, in
    my book, was CorellDraw! 4 coming out on CD-ROM. Oh, sure I know that
    OS/2 and a slew of other large programs came out on CD-ROM, but I feel that
    CorellDraw tells the story best. Although it came out on both CD and disc the
    versions were not the same. The CD contained hundreds of extra fonts and
    thousands of extra clip-art pictures. Now the reason I feel that this is important
    is that there is no good way to pirate this. Even if you totally ignore the
    manuals, the warranty, the support, your time, the ethical concerns, and
    consider only the cost of storing the information, you'll find it costs more than
    it's worth to pirate it. Floppy, floptical, hard drive, MO, WORM, will all cost you
    more than it w

  </p>
  <p>I'm not sure of the exact stats on the percent of pirated CDs, but I'm sure it's
    near 0, compared to about 50% for most other software. This is a very
    important result. Designers of CD-ROM software are receiving their just
    rewards. As more and more people buy CD-ROM drives, more and more
    designers will put their new software on CD-ROM, and will take advantage of
    the properties of this medium.

  </p>
  <p>And the dirty, hidden, unspoken, secret question that lingers in the dark
    recesses of many pirates. "What about us?". Well, It's good for you too! (For
    those of you who are not sure if you are a pirate or not, if you have any
    software that is not public domain, and you have not paid for it, you are a
    pirate.) The benefits of the CD-ROM uprising are many, and far-reaching.
    First off, you don't have to break the law to feel you are getting the most out of
    your computer (Competition is usually more important than objective
    performance.). There is no risk of getting caught, and facing penalties. All of
    your software will have manuals (Sure, you'll still jump right in without reading
    them, but they save valuable hours when you get in a fix, and help you fully
    utilize the product. Besides the manuals for games are cool to read.). I've
    seen people who have hard drives full of pirated software, but still can barely
    use their machine. They have no manuals, so they scarcely know what their
    software does, much less how

  </p>
  <p>So why is piracy so prevalent?
    Well, there are a number of users
    willing to spend the extra time it
    takes to learn a software package
    without the manual. For those who
    do not it is the illusion of getting
    something for nothing, an under-
    estimation of the value of their time,
    the idea that everyone is doing it so
    it's OK, lack of knowledge, and trust.
    The last two are closely linked. Most
    people when they first get their
    machine know next to nothing about
    it. So, they get a hold of someone
    who does to come over and `fix-up'
    their machine for them. This usually
    consists of helping them understand
    their bundled software, configuring
    their memory, and filling their hard
    drive. When you don't know what
    you are doing you trust those who
    do. When an experienced user
    pirates software for you, you assume
    he/she's doing you a favour. The
    end-result certainly does not look
    that way. So there goes the average
    family with their 2.7 kids, 2 car
    garage, and a desktop machine full
    of potential, and no way to use it.

  </p>
  <p>The advantages reach far beyond
    forcing us to be honest. The fact that
    designers will be paid for each and
    every copy that is sold means
    designers will make more money.
    The more money that is going to
    designers, the competition on the
    part of designers to receive a bigger
    slice of the pie. This results in lower
    prices and higher quality software on
    CD-ROM. This, of course has a
    circular effect of more people buying
    CD-ROM drives to tap into this neat
    stuff.

  </p>
  <p>Let me not forget the direct
    advantages of the media form itself.
    640 MB of space goes a long way,
    and provides opportunity for many
    forms of multi-media to be realized.
    Also, because they are read-only
    you need not worry about them
    becoming infected with viruses. For
    those whom are looking to buy a
    CD-ROM drive, I wouldn't suggest
    getting anything slower than a
    doublespin (300K/s). The strength of
    CD-ROM lies in the bulk of video it
    can store. On a standard CD-ROM
    the refresh rate is just too slow. For
    those who thought this article was

  This is what happens when you don't stick to the
  bunnny hill. But it was a valiant group effort.

  Some people were so anxious to ski, they even tooked
  a closed highway to get there!

  After a hard day of non-stop skiing, a bit or relaxing

  <h3>Comming To A Computer Near You!</h3>
  <p>
    <i>by: Alain Siodlowski</i>

  </p>
  <p>If you have had the chance to try
    the World Wide Web with Mosaic
    (xmosaic, WinMosaic etc.) , then you
    can appreciate the usefullness of
    HyperText and global infomation
    access (like the WWW, gopher,
    WAIS, etc.). The University of
    Windsor not only has access to the
    WWW, but also has documents on it.
    The WWW is basically a giant
    Hyper-linked document. But
    individual "pages" can be located on
    different systems around the world.
    The WWW also supports multi-
    media. Thus it not only contains text,
    but also images, animation and
    sound.

  </p>
  <p>Starting this year, the Wisdom (and
    other info from, the C.S.S.) will be
    available on Mosaic. The transfer
    will be made soon (when I have the
    time to do it). But the Wisdom will
    still be published on paper, at least
    until xmosaic is easily accessible on
    the SGI. Mosaic is, at the moment,
    available on the SUN system and on
    the Computer Centre's Novell
    network (Windows). Documents are
    stored on turner.lamf.uwindsor.ca in
    the School of Computer Science.

  </p>
  <p>As for the Wisdom itself, well... I'm
    still trying to get more articles from
    the general membership (i.e. YOU!)
    on various subjects (tips, review of
    new technologies, how to hook up a
    VAX in your house(remember it's 3
    phase), etc.). There is the usual
    $5.00 for any articles published. You
    don't have to be a world class
    author, just interested. Submit any
    articles (or questions, suggestions)
    to: wisdom@cs.uwindsor.ca

    <h2>C.S.S. Hits The Ski Slope</h2>
  </a>
  <p>
    <i>by Alain Siodlowski</i>

  </p>
  <p>The ski trip to Blue Mountain, Collinwood,
    was a chance for many to try
    out new experiences. A few people hit the slopes
    (literally, they fell), others
    came in close contact with nature (i.e. hit a tree)
    or met new people (ran in
    to them) and some felt the cool soothing (almost
    religious) effects of the
    bathroom floor (after a long gruelling night of
    partying). But no one got hurt
    and no one got sued. The
    skiing conditions were
    excellent and the slopes not
    too crowded. In all about 70
    people went on the trip, and
    came back in one piece.

  </p>
  <p>The trip started on Friday
    the 21st of Jan. at around
    11:30am for most of us. The
    bus arrived at Blue
    Mountain on time. Others
    who took there cars also
    arrived, more or less, at the
    same time. But for one
    group of four people, who
    took Highway 24, it took a
    little longer due to poor (sometimes non-existent)
    visibility. See the photo on
    the next page, taken after they got off the
    highway.

  </p>
  <p>Friday night was cold and very windy. Going up the ski lift (against the
    wind) was just a joy. Going down felt like having rockets strapped to your
    back. Some people started partying as soon as they arrived at Blue
    Mountain, others waited until the slopes closed at 10:00 pm before starting.

  </p>
  <p>Saturday, when everyone got up (around noon or so), the sun was
    shinning and slopes full of people. The weather was perfect for skiing. This
    was also the day when most of us took full advantage of the fully equipped
    kitchens we had in our condos. Spaghetti, pork chops, pies etc. where
    prepared. Some of us also had a chance to see downtown Collinwood while
    replenishing our supplies. We also got to see some
    of the facilities of the resort, such as the pool,
    sauna, indoor tennis courts, restaurants and the
    night clubs.

  </p>
  <p>Sunday we had to be out of the condos by 11:00
    am and we were on our way back to Windsor. The
    trip was fun and for those of you who missed it,
    reserve your spot early for our next ski trip next
    year.

  <p>"No! you can't use the computers here."

  </p>
  <p>This is what you can expect if
    you want to work on a word perfect
    document in the Odette computer
    lab. It does not matter if you are a
    computer science student, or if the
    Odette lab is empty, and the
    computer center is full. All that
    matters is that you are a business
    student! But, most Computer
    Science students take business
    courses. Why can't we use an empty
    computer lab when the other lab is
    overflowing? "The business
    department paid for the lab" said Mr.
    Walter Manney. False! You paid for
    the lab with your ever increasing
    tuition fees. When will we all work
    together on issues like these. This is
    a place for learning and growing!
