      Since Canadian author William Gibson first referred to the term
      "cyberpunk" in his 1984 sci fi novel Neuromancer, a new group of
      computer techies has adopted the name to describe its cult like
      devotion to computers.</a>

   <h2>Are You A Cyberpunk? -- Figure It Out</h2>
   <p>
      <i>by Ursula Bagnell</i>

   </p>
   <p>
      Question: What do you get when you cross an 80's computer geek
      with a 60's acid-head whose anarchic tendencies are as fresh as his
      last trip? - Mondo 2000

   </p>
   <p>
      A 90's cyberpunk, that's what! And calling them "geeks" unless you
      are part of that elite group of hackers which is battling this age
      of information overflow, on their own terms. Surrender to your
      computer, but not to authority, so I've heard one say. Gone is the
      stereotypical nerd who played Spaced Invaders for hours upon hour
      in his parents basement: this cross breed developed the game. the
      new wave is deep and the rest of you computer illiterates had
      better catch the wave.

   </p>
   <p>
      I've seen many of you down there on the telnet for hours upon hours
      "mooing" or "mushing" <tosh, eric,="" john.....=""> :) For those of you
         who have heard of the term "mooing" using the telnet feature on the
         x-terminals but are not quite sure as to what it is I will explain.

      </tosh,>
   </p>
   <p>
      Cyberpunk is about being able to artistically interact with anyone
      anywhere in the world. When 2 people in different geographical
      contexts are networking through telnet or other by modem, you've
      got cyberspace.

   </p>
   <p>
      Mooing actually works like this: One night in december I ventured
      down to the computer centre to check my email before studying for
      finals <bad move!="">. Some of my friends were down there. They
         seemed to be having a great time laughing and talking to
         themselves, oh I mean the computer. I thought they were crazy! So
         being very inquisitive, I asked then what exactly they were doing.
         Oh no! that did it I was hooked. I was fascinated at the fact
         that I could talk to weird and strange people in far off places
         (eg: Alaska, Boston..etc). The characters were 'different'. I
         finally noticed that the people used their characters as their
         escape from reality. Everybody on the system had their own alias
         name. I got on as a "guest". I acquired limited powers to do
         anything. It was very different then anything I have ever
         experienced before. It is addictive like drugs. I figure people
         use drugs to 'escape' from reality, and drugs are additive, this
         could be dangerous to some. So don't go on it unless you can
         handle it!

      Definition: 'si-ber' pungkn 1. a late 20th century techno-
      revolutionary or someone who poses as such 2. a hard boiled
      hacker with anarchist inclinations 3. a computer geek who likes
      Ministry 4. as seen in TIME magazine, a member of a counter-
      cultural "movement" of the same name, characterized by a
      combination of technological savvy with a rebellious lifestyle 5.
      Billy Idole's comeback album 6. someone who has delusions about
      living in the future 7. someone who maintains that mirrorshade
      sunglasses (last seen on CHIPS) never went out of fashion. This
      definition has been brought to you by the cyber-sci-fi magazine
      Mondo 2000.

   <p>
      They are sometimes called the 'boys with toys' but simply
      cyberpunks view technology as empowering. "Lady Night Mare", one
      of the few females in the predominantly male environment of
      computers, expands on the cyberpunk vision in her column in the
      media newspaper TransForum. "Cyberpunks recognized that several
      different planes of reality exist - and it is their mandate to
      constantly search for new doorways to the further reaches of
      psyche... it is the evolution of said rituals that prevent them
      from being sucked into a homogeneous vortex of conformity.

   </p>
   <p>
      To Gibson, technology means 'much more than computers, modems and
      virtual reality. "Technology is what you do with it. It is not
      stuff that we can just take in and out of cardboard boxes.
      Technology is your dental work and all the adjustments done to your
      antibodies since birth", says Gibson. "It's the sum total of
      everything; it's not just a bunch of gadgets from Japan."

   </p>
   <p>
      Cyberpunk followers say the computer revolution celebrates the
      individual, not a slavish devotion to a machine. Denizens of the
      new technology, ie Gibson, also argue that the philosophical
      connection to the '60's does not necessarily extend to drug use.
      Although the image of hip youth stoked on technology has been
      perpetuated type,the use of hallucinogens is not needed to create
      the pure software high of a Virtual Reality experience [VR is an
      artificially created world achieved by wearing a head-set equipped
      with small image-bearing screens. It is the ultimate extension of
      cyberspace]. As Timothy Leary, a computer techie says, VR is the
      socially acceptable LSD of the 90's.

   </p>
   <p>
      To call every artist who embraces this techno-culture a cyberpunk
      is a mistake. Even if the new wave of computer "geeks" dispels the
      image of a pre-pubescent slug who indulges his every sexual fantasy
      on a computer many want to distance themselves from this media-
      created image.

   </p>
   <p>
      Now I'm not trying to say that everybody that 'moo's or mushs' in
      the computer centre is a computer geek. Don't get me wrong, I was
      down there. I'm talking about those people who get so involved in
      this cyber space 'trip', those that can't distinguish between
      reality and absurdity the pre-pubescent slug. Anyhow from personal
      experience the cyber features available on the internet are
      additive, and in some cases dangerous. As long is you can still
      distinguish between reality and absurdity then you are doing o.k.

      <b>Beta-Tester's Joystick Sliced Off While Sleeping at Computer!</b></p>
   <p>

      At a news conference today, a beta tester of software said that he had
      fallen asleep while testing a game for id Software, developers of the
      best-seliing game Wolfenstein 3D. Awaking in the middle of the night,
      he looked down and to his horror discovered that three-fourths of his
      joystick had been sliced cleanly off. When questioned, id Software
      admitted to doing the deed and charged that the beta tester was a
      two-timer. Id spokesman Shawn Green stated-- "What was done had to be
      done. Id was definitely not satisfied by this guy's performance. All he
      cared about was taking software and sticking it into other people's hard
      drives!".

   </p>
   <p>

      The severed joystick was later found by police on a street corner.
      Apparently id had fled the scene with the sliced piece still in hand and
      tossed it out a car window. Surgeons have since sewn the stick back on,
      but it seems to malfunction whenever playing id's beta software.
      Doctors predict that the joystick should perform normally again by
      December 10th.

   <p>
      You know you have been playing DOOM too long...

   <ul>

      <li>...when going to sleep you open the bedroom's door and instead of turning
         lights on you fire a missile into the room.

      </li>
      <li>...when you sleep with a chainsaw under your pillow,and justify it with 'you
         never know what lurks in the dark'.

      </li>
      <li>...when going into a room or getting off an elevator, you run in and out
         quickly to see what follows you out.

      </li>
      <li>...you don't worry so much about getting hurt, since you'll probably pick
         up one of those blue spheres somewhere.

      </li>
      <li>...watching someone come out of an elevator makes your mouse finger twitch

      </li>
      <li>...when the dog growls and you dive over the couch while
         reaching for a shotgun.

      </li>
      <li>...when you start side-stepping into rooms.

      </li>
      <li>...when you push on a wall as you walk down the hall looking for secret
         entrances

      </li>
      <li>...when you rush for a neon-blue down vest in K-Mart

      </li>
      <li>...when you reach for your chainsaw when your wife's cold

      </li>
      <li>...when you search for a radiation suit before going into
         a swimming pool

      </li>
      <li>...when you instinctively target trash cans while walking
         around campus/work

      </li>
      <li>...when you look for sniper spots above you when getting in an elevator.

      </li>
      <li>...when you can't stop squinting as you walk around your house

      </li>
      <li>...when you think you can actually walk through walls

      </li>
      <li>...when you start making chainsaw noises if you hear a strange noise.

      </li>
      <li>...when you wish you had a chainsaw, just in case.

      </li>
      <li>...when you buy a radiation suit and Infra-red goggles, just in case.
