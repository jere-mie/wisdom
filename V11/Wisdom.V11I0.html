    Yes its the new school year and what better way to
    start than a gathering to meet all the fresh faces as well
    as the more familiar ones. I am referring to the CSS
    General Meeting of computer science students, CSS
    executive and friends. You will have a chance to meet
    and talk with your computer science society
    representatives as well as other computer science
    students. Everyone is welcome, it is a great chance to
    find out what the society has to offer and to voice your
    ideas and comments.

  </p>
  <p>
    We will be talking about past and future events, what
    the society has been up to, and other society business.
    Afterwards will be a chance to get to know everyone
    and have fun. The date is october 13th, the location will
    be advertised later in the WISDOM and in your
    classes, or just come to the office in the student center
    and ask.

    <h2>Ridding The InfoBahn With The C.S.S.</h2>
  </a>
  <p>
    <i>by Alain Siodlowski</i></p>
  <p>

    You have all heard about the information super
    highway, and how it will do this and that and that we will
    all be connected etc, etc, etc. Well the information
    super highway does, sort of, exist right now. It is the
    Internet and the University of Windsor is connected to
    it. The Internet is a connection of several networks,
    which are, themselves, connections of networks. All
    this lets you communicate with other computers around
    the world. One of the best ways to ride on the Internet
    is with a program called Mosaic that "rides" the World
    Wide Web. This Web offers two big advantages over
    other programs such as FTP and gopher. It uses hyper
    text and multimedia.

  </p>
  <p>
    The best way to understand the Web, is to use it.
    Things that are underlined are links to other
    documents. It is this cross-linking of documents that
    gives rise to the Web in World Wide Web. the World
    Wide parts comes the fact that the Internet spans
    almost the entire planet. To call up Mosaic on the SGI
    system or on the CS department's SUN
    system, just type xmosaic &amp;. From the SUN system, you can
    also call it up from the Root Menu, under Connections &amp; Comm.
    On the Novell network at
    the University Computer Centre, go into Windows and
    click on Mosaic. Once the program has started, you'll
    be in the Faculty of Science Web posting. From here
    you can browse around. Remember, clicking on
    something that is underlined will bring to more info.
    Also, clicking on an image will sometimes bring you to
    another document or download the full size image.

  </p>
  <p>
    Well the Computer Science Society is now on the
    World Wide Web. All our Wisdom
    newsletters will be "printed" on the
    Web and we will stop printing on
    paper. This is the last paper issue.
    To get to our Web posting, click on
    Computer Science Society in the
    Faculty of Science page (when you
    start Mosaic at the University of
    Windsor, you're automatically sent to
    this page). Once you're in our home-
    page, go under the Navigate menu
    and chose Add Current to Hotlist.
    This way you can access our page
    from the hot list. You can also
    specify from the command line
    (when calling up xmosaic) what
    document you want to go to right-
    away. As of this publishing time, we
    still don't know what the exact path
    to our home-page is.

  </p>
  <p>
    On the WWW we will have back
    issues of the Wisdom as well as all
    the new ones. The new "issues" will
    be updated as articles are sent in.
    We will also have current
    announcements about up-coming
    events. Check this section on a
    weekly basis. There will also be a
    "photo album" containing photos of
    past events. This section should be
    ready soon.

  </p>
  <p>
    If anyone would like to submit an
    article for the Wisdom, send it e-mail
    to wisdom@cs.uwindsor.ca or give it
    to one of the exec members in class
    or at the office. If you are a C.S.S.
    member, then you get $5.00 for an
    article (for more information, see
    me). You don't have to be a Pulitzer
    Prize winner, just have something
    interesting to write about such as
    new technology, things happening
    here on campus etc.

  </p>
  <p>
    If anyone has any suggestions for
    the Wisdom and/or our WWW
    posting, talk to us or e-mail us.

    <h2>Social? You Mean Do Stuff...</h2>
  </a>

  <p>

    Welcome back to school everyone. The Computer
    Science Society has been hard at work all summer
    making plans to ensure that this year is even better
    than last. As vice-president in charge of social
    functions, it's my job to get as many of you as possible
    out to our events. Work is already hard under way on
    the Welcome Back to School Cedar Point trip which is
    coming up in the next few weeks. It's a great way to get
    to know people, especially for those
    of you that are new to the school or
    to computer science.

  </p>
  <p>
    Don't make the same mistake I did.
    I regret that I didn't get involved with
    the Computer Science Society until
    my third year of university. Not only
    did I meet a great group of friends
    but I was also surrounded by people
    who could help me with homework
    and tests. So drop by the office
    sometime and get to know the
    people there. This is your society too
    so be a part of it.

    Hi there everyone. My name is
    Stacey Gallant and I am this year's
    Vice President of Academic Affairs
    for the Computer Science Society. It
    is my job to oversee any of the
    society's academic events, and to
    also help out any student (to the
    best of my ability) who has questions
    or problems with a course,
    professor, etc.

  </p>
  <p>
    Later on in the year I will be
    arranging to have someone come in
    and speak on a, yet to be
    determined, computer-related topic.
    If anyone has any suggestions as to
    what the topic should be you can
    either hand them in to me at the
    CSS office (2nd floor CAW Student
    Centre) or you can e-mail me at
    gallana@server.uwindsor.ca

  <h2><a name="beginning">In The Beginning...</a></h2>
  <p>
    <i>by: Dario Sfalcin</i></p>
  <p>

    In the beginning there was
    darkness. Mankind roamed the earth
    without direction, no remorse over
    the past, no concern over the future.
    This made the gods very unhappy.
    Something had to be done and after
    millennia of gruelling labour (even
    for gods) their creation was
    complete. It was to be the savior of
    humanity and the planet we call
    earth. So, on the sixteenth day of the
    eighth month of the year nineteen
    hundred seventy three he was born
    to the earth in all his glory. The gods
    feasted on ambrosia and nectar,
    peasants danced in the streets,
    birds sang and small children
    played.

  </p>
  <p>
    The child grew to be a very
    handsome young man with many
    cool friends but from deep within him
    there was a feeling of
    incompleteness. Finally, he decided
    to enrich his university experience
    and fulfill his destiny by running for
    Computer Science Society
    President. The gods were pleased
    with this decision which may allow
    the chosen one to touch the lives of
    his fellow students. After the election
    was complete and the dust had
    cleared the chosen one was now to
    be hailed the great Dario Delano
    Sfalcin.

  </p>
  <p>
    The C.S.S. organizes many
    different events for all types of
    people and we are hoping to see a
    lot of new faces at our upcoming
    events. Elections are to be held in a
    few weeks with nominations opening
    this week. There are positions open
    for first and second year reps. and
    one member for school council. Stop
    by the office any time between
    10:00am and 4:00pm to talk with
    society members and sign up for
    some activities. We are also opening
    an extensive exam bank that could
    help you with your courses.

  </p>
  <p>
    If you have any questions or
    suggestions either stop by the office
    (CAW student centre) or send e-mail
    to: sfalci1@server.uwindsor.ca

  <h2><a name="hello">Hello How Are You... Or Whatever... Like I Care</a></h2>
  <p>
    <i>by: Roberto Casagrande</i></p>
  <p>

    I guess this is where I am supposed to greet all the new and old Computer
    Science students, HI! Happy now? If you're new here, than you are more than
    likely fresh out of some secondary school all pumped to be in university. You
    have new clothes, new school gear, and new other crap. Minds full of some
    strange notion that university life is some great adventure and full of fantastic
    new ideas, interesting people, and challenging classes that will expand your
    minds and horizons.

  </p>
  <p><b>WELL SNAP OUT OF IT!</b></p>
  <p>

    You have just entered Hell, only a lot colder, we are in Canada after all, eh?
    People here are no more interesting than anywhere else. Classes are not only
    challenging, they are down right torturous. They will not only expand your
    mind, they will make it feel like it will explode out of your skull. Ask all the
    masochistic old students who came back for more. I say WELCOME... and
    good luck. I suppose I should also say a few words about myself, Roberto
    Casagrande. That is my name after all. My title in the Computer Science
    Society (CSS) is VP Administration.

  </p>
  <p>
    The fancy name means that I am in charge of the funds of the society, and
    organize some of the events during the year. I am a third year honors student
    in the school of Computer Science, and I too was once a first year student
    knowing nothing of what university does to the human spirit. How it eats at
    you until you are a mere shell of a person. Life will slowly seep out your mind
    in order to make room for all the data necessary for survival against the
    dreaded midterm, saying nothing of the horror of the finals.

  </p>
  <p>
    You are probably wondering how I was chosen for this position... my
    optimistic outlook on life of course. My views on the joys of school and the
    excitement I have for my classes makes me a perfect choice for
    administration. My good nature and pleasant repertoire with others also
    helped along with the fact no one dare run against me. Well that is enough
    about me, I hope your year is a great one and I look forward to meeting the
    rest of my fellow computer scientists.

    people of what we are doing. Let me tell ya this year is going to be great!!! We
    have a lot of things organized to keep all you computer science students busy.
    Hey let me fill you in on some really neat stuff we did last year. We went to
    Cedar Point, had awesome movie nights, played volleyball and partied on
    thursday nights, went skiing in Blue Mountain. Oh we had a great time! But
    this year will be even better! We have a lot of cool things organized. This year
    will be even better than last.

  </p>
  <p>
    O.K. I know what you are probably saying now.... Computer Science
    society... what a bunch of geeks... WRONG!!!!!!!!!! We are a society NOT a
